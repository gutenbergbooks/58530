<p class="pfirst spitalic">We know Egypt, thanks to her tombs, and
we know Rome, thanks to Pompeii, in these modern days, better than
we know the Middle Ages of Europe and the life of an ordinary man
during that period. We cannot hope to find in any corner of France or
England a Pompeii, catacombs, or pyramids. In our countries the human
torrent has never ceased flowing; rapid and tumultuous in its course,
it has at no time ensured the preservation of the past by deposits of
quiet ooze.</p>

<p class="spitalic">Yet, this common life of our ancestors, is it indiscernible,
impossible to reconstruct? is that of kings and princes alone
accessible to our view through the remoteness of ages, like those
huge monuments which men see from afar when they cannot
distinguish the houses in a distant city? Surely not. But to
reach the heart of the nation, to get into touch with the greater
number, a patient and extended inquiry is necessary. To make
this usefully, one must break more or less completely with the
old habit of taking the ideas of every-day life in the Middle
Ages only from the descriptions, the satires, or the eulogies of
poets. Literature is no doubt of valuable help in these restorations,
but it is not the only, nor even the principal source of
information. Poets embellish, imagine, colour, or transform;
we must not accept their statements without checking them.</p>

<p class="spitalic">To check them is what we can do. We may
have no such <span class="xxpn" id="p008">{8}</span>
burial grounds to explore as in Egypt, nor a whole town to bring to
light as at Pompeii, but we have what is worth almost as much:
the incomparable depositories of the Records of old England.
Immense strides have been made, especially within the last
hundred years, to render their contents public. Thousands

of documents have been printed or analysed, and the work is
still continuing; indeed, looking at the progress made of late,
a feeling of wonder cannot be repressed at the premature alarm
of historians like Robertson, who wrote in 1769: “The
universal progress of science during the two last centuries,
the art of printing, and other obvious causes, have filled Europe
with such a multiplicity of histories, and with such a vast
collection of historical materials, that the term of human life
is too short for the study or even the perusal of them.” The
field of research has never ceased to widen, while the boundaries
of human life scarcely recede at all; but students comprehend
that the best means of rendering service is to impose limits on
themselves and to study by preference separate points or periods
of the immense problem to the best of their power. The work
of unearthing is so far advanced that it is possible usefully to
sift the riches drawn from these new catacombs.</p>

<p class="spitalic">At first sight all these petitions, these year-books full of
reports of lawsuits, these long rows of statutes and ordinances
seem the coldest things in the world, the most devoid of life.
They are not even mummies or skeletons, they look as if they
were but the dust of old bones. Yet to judge of them thus
were to judge in a superficial manner; no doubt it might
seem pleasanter to keep to the descriptions of tale-tellers; but
how many chances of error do they not present! With the
year-books, and the petitions followed by inquiries, we are
on distinctly more solid ground; we soon grow accustomed to
their language, and, under the apparently cold dust, sparks
of life appear, we can then with little effort restore scenes, understand
existences, perceive the distant echo of imprecations or
shouts of triumph.</p>

<p class="spitalic">It was with this thought that the
present work was <span class="xxpn" id="p009">{9}</span>
undertaken a good many years ago. In it there is a little less
mention of Chaucer and a little more of the “Rolls of Parliament”
than is sometimes found in the works devoted to
the same period; this does not arise from want of admiration
for the great man, far from it, but from the need of a
test and of means of control, which may perhaps be deemed
legitimate, and only increase, in the end, our sentiment for
him. The present writer has desired to confine himself in
this work within strict limits; one only of the many sides of
the common life in the fourteenth century is here studied, a
side little enough known and sometimes difficult to observe,
namely, the character and the quality of the chief kinds of
nomadic existence then carried on in England. And even in
that reduced compass he is very far from making claim to
completeness; so that this work is presented to the public
more as a sketch than a treatise.</p>

<p class="spitalic">In the remodelling of his text, which had appeared as
a French book in 1884 and as articles in English some years
earlier, the author has been assisted, he need hardly say, by
his learned translator, to whom he owes much for having
assumed the task of turning into English a work which she
herself would have been so well qualified to write. He has
been helped too by friends, all of whom he does not mean to
name here. But though feeling that in this also his incompleteness
will be very apparent, he cannot deprive himself of the
pleasure of inscribing on this page with gratitude and affection
the names of Gaston Paris, of the Institute of France; of
E. Maunde Thompson, Principal Librarian of the British
Museum; of F. J. Furnivall, Director of the Chaucer and many
other Societies; lastly, he ought, perhaps, to have said firstly,
of the poet and critic, Edmund Gosse, to whose kind initiative
and suggestion he owes it that his book is published under its
present form.</p>

<p class="spitalic padtopa" id="p010">At the time of “les longs
espoirs et les vastes pensées,” so far back that I have but
a hazy recollection of him, the young author of these pages
had formed so bold a plan that he kept it to himself, which
was to write, if a long life were granted him, a complete
description of the English people, during it is true a
single century, the fourteenth, that period, of unique
interest, when, after long years of probation, it became
certain that England would be English and nothing else,
when the language was formed, the first masterpieces were
written, the chief traits of the national character became
permanent, the principal institutions were founded, and
even a first attempt at Reformation was launched.</p>

<p class="spitalic">Old Barthélemy Saint Hilaire, the
indefatigable translator of Aristotle, used to say to me
when he was our Foreign Minister: one must select, early
in life, a vast intellectual task, that will be like a
literary companion, a long-lived one, which you can never
lose, because it is sure to outlive you. The author of
this study thought the ampler work would be his literary
companion.</p>

<p class="spitalic">But his official duties thereupon became more exacting,
and as they had a first claim, he had to part with his companion,
whom, as will happen in life’s pilgrimage, others replaced
at later stages of the journey. He desired, however, that
some trace be left of an early comradeship: hence the present
essay, illustrated in part from his pen-and-ink sketches, also
a token of comradeship.</p>

<p class="spitalic">The need of this new issue has supplied the occasion for
a revision of the text, with numerous corrections and additions,
written in a land unsuspected by the best-travelled
of the ever-moving heroes of these pages, written too at a time
when the Hundred years war of Chaucerian days has been
replaced by a Hundred years peace, and when great deeds
performed in common are, if we and our successors prove in
any way worthy of our dead, the harbingers of a friendship
not to be broken between France, England and America.</p>

Old London Bridge. From an illumination in the MS. 16 F. ii.
fol. 73, in the British Museum, containing the poems of Charles
d’Orléans (fifteenth century). This is the oldest representation
extant of the famous bridge built by Isembert and his peers.
The painting, of which the upper part only is here given, represents
the Tower of London with Charles d’Orléans sitting in
it as a prisoner. In our reproduction may be seen the chapel
of St. Thomas Becket and the houses on the bridge, the wharves
along the City side of the water, and the tops of the white turrets
of the Tower of London. The view was obviously painted
from nature. A complete reproduction serves as a frontispiece
for Vol. I of my “Literary <span class="spwsa">History.”

The parliament sitting in Westminster. From the MS.
Harl. 1319, in the British Museum, fol. 57, painted circa
1400. This MS. contains a chronicle of the last years of
Richard II, written in his native tongue by a French gentleman
called Créton, who accompanied the king in his last
journey to Ireland. It is invaluable both for its text and its
pictures; in both the author seems to have been very careful
to adhere to facts. He begins writing in verse, but afterwards
takes to prose, stating that he is coming now to events of such
importance that he prefers using prose, to make sure that he
shall not allow himself to be led by fancy.</p>

<p>He must have himself superintended the painting with the
greatest care. There can be no doubt that the figures are
actual portraits; of this there are two proofs: first, when the
same person appears in several paintings he is always given the
same features, and can be easily recognized; second, the exact
resemblance of one of the persons can be put beyond a doubt,
which makes it likely that the others also resemble their originals.
Richard II, the image of whom constantly recurs in the pictures,
is easily recognizable as having the same features as in the bronze
statue over his tomb at Westminster. And we know for certain
that this tomb and statue were ordered by Richard himself
during his lifetime; the indenture with the seals attached,
dated 18 Rich. II (1395), and binding two apparently English
artists, viz., “Nicholas Broker et Godfrey Prest, citeins et
copersmythes de Loundres,” is still in existence at the Record
Office.</p>

<p>The sitting of the parliament here represented is the famous
one when Richard was deposed, and Henry of Lancaster came
<span id="p015">forth</span> to “chalenge yis Rewme of Yngland” (“Rolls of Parliament,”
iii. p. 422), Oct. 1399, and the throne was then, as
seen in the painting, left unoccupied, “sede regali cum pannis
auri solempniter preparata, tunc vacua,” “Rolls,” ibid. On
the right of the throne are seated the spiritual lords; on the
left the temporal lords, knights, &amp;c. The nearest to the throne
left is Henry of Lancaster (wearing a tall fur cap). Says
Créton:</p>

A family dinner. From the MS. Addit. 28162, in the British
Museum, fol. 10 <i>b</i>, early fourteenth century; French. Note
the carver, the cup-bearer, the musicians, the marshal of the
hall, whose mission it is to expel objectionable intruders,
whether men or dogs. In the present case, while this officer
is expelling a very objectionable lazar, come under pretence of
sprinkling the diners with holy water, a little further a dog
seizes his opportunity, and gets hold of a fish on the table. The
carver grasps the meat with his left hand; forks then were
unknown, but good breeding was, nevertheless, not neglected,
and it consisted in the server’s touching the meat only with
the <i>left</i> hand. Writing later than the time we speak of, John
Russell, marshal of the hall to Duke Humphrey of Gloucester
(fifteenth century), adds one refinement more, that is to use only
three fingers of the left hand. This was, in his mind, the acme
of fine breeding:</p>

A Hermit in his solitude, tempted by the devil; MS. 10 E.
IV., fol. 113 <i>b</i>. The miniature reproduced is one out of several
which illustrate a well-known mediæval tale. Here it may
be remarked that though this MS., invaluable as it is for the
study of English customs, dresses, &amp;c., during the fourteenth
century has been often made use of, it has perhaps never been
so thoroughly studied as it deserves. It contains Decretals,
with marginal coloured drawings of the highest value on account
of their variety and the subjects they illustrate. Not only a
number of games and trades are there represented, with many
miracles of the Virgin, &amp;c., but there are also complete tales
told by the draughtsman, without words, and only with the
help of his colours. He does not invent his stories, but simply
illustrates the <i>fabliaux</i> which he remembered and particularly
relished. The drawing here belongs to the story of the
“hermit who got drunk.” As he was once sitting before his
cell he was tempted by the devil, who reproached him with
his continual virtue, and entreated him to sin at least once,
recommending him to choose either to get drunk or to commit
adultery or to commit murder. The hermit chose the first
as being the least (see below, p.
<a href="#fig28" title="go to Illustration 28">133</a>, the picture where he is
seen at his drink). But when he has once got drunk he finds
on his way the wife of his friend the miller; he commits adultery
with her, and then meeting the husband, kills him. The text of
the tale is in Méon, “Nouveau recueil de fabliaux,” 1829,
vol. ii. p. 173, “De l’ermite qui <span class="spwsa">s’enyvra”

Reaping time. Labourers reaping corn under the supervision
of the hayward. From the MS. 2 B. vii., fol. 78 <i>b</i>. English,
early fourteenth century. “They dwell in fayre houses, and
we haue the payne and traueyle, rayne and wynd in the feldes”
(speech of John Ball, in Lord Berners’ Froissart, chap. ccclxxxi).
The overseer shown in the drawing may possibly be a bailiff:
“Supervidere debet ballivus falcatores, messores, cariatores,”
&amp;c. (“Fleta,” cap. 73), or a provost, who had about the same
duties, but was practically chosen by the peasants themselves.
But it seems more likely to be a hayward; the dress and attitude
better suit a man in that station. The care of seeing that “repemen
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. repe besili and clenli,” was sometimes entrusted to
such officers; see Skeat, “Notes to Piers the Plowman,” Early
English Text Society, 1877, p. 273. A horn, such as our
man bears, was always carried by haywards, who used to
blow it to warn off people from straying in the crops. The
rough and commanding attitude seen in the drawing would not
be so readily expected from a bailiff with his juridical knowledge
and com­par­a­tive­ly high function, or from a provost
appointed by the peasants themselves, as from a hayward or

A blind beggar and his boy. The
trick played upon the blind man by his boy is well known
as being one of the incidents in the first chapter of the
sixteenth-century Spanish novel, “Lazarillo de Tormes.” It
has long been suspected that the materials for this chapter
were drawn by the Spanish author from an earlier tale. This
drawing and several others that follow it, never adverted
to with reference to “Lazarillo de Tormes,” put the fact
beyond a doubt; they tell in their way the same tale, and
they are of the first part of the fourteenth century. MS.

<p class="pfirst">At the present day there are but few wayfarers.
The small trades plyed along the road, in
every chance village, are disappearing before our
newer methods of wholesale manufacture; more and
more rarely do we see the pedlar unstrap his pack at the
farm door, the travelling cobbler mend by the wayside
the shoes which on Sunday will replace the wooden clogs,
or hear the wandering musician drone at the windows
his oft rehearsed tunes. Professional pilgrims exist no
longer, even quack doctors are losing their credit. It
was far otherwise in the Middle Ages; many people
were bound to a wandering existence, and started even
from childhood on their life-long journey. Some trotted
their strange industries in the broad sunshine, through the
dust of the highroads; others skulked
in bye-lanes or <span class="xxpn" id="p024">{24}</span>
even in coppices, hiding their heads from the sheriff’s
officer—may be a criminal, may be a fugitive, “a wolf’s
head that anyone may cut down,” according to the terrible
expression of an English jurist of the thirteenth century.
Among these, many labourers who had broken the villeins
bond, unhappy and oppressed in their hamlets, and
who wandered through the country in quest of work,
as though flight could enfranchise them: but “service
est en le sank” (“service is in the blood”), the magistrate
warned them.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn1" id="fnanc1">1</a>
Among them also, pedlars laden
with petty wares; pilgrims who from St. Thomas’ to
St. James’ went begging along the roads, living by alms;
pardoners, those strange nomads, who sold to the
common people the merits of the saints in paradise;
mendicant friars and preachers of all sorts who, according
to the times, delivered ardently liberal harangues or
contemptibly selfish discourses at the church doors.
All these had one character in common, namely, that in
the wide extent of country where they passed their
lives, ever on the move, they served as links between
the separated groups of other men who, attached to the
soil by law or custom, spent the whole of their days,
irremovable, under the same sky, on the same ground,
at the same toil.</p>

<p>Pursuing their singular work, these wanderers, who
had seen and experienced so much, served to give
some idea of the great unknown world to the humble
classes whom they met on their way. Together with
many false beliefs and fables they put into the heads of
the stay-at-homes certain notions of extent and of active
life which these would hardly otherwise have acquired;
above all, they brought to the land-bound men news of
their brethren in the neighbouring province, of their
condition of misery or of happiness, and these
were pitied <span class="xxpn" id="p025">{25}</span>
or envied accordingly, and remembered as brothers or
friends to call upon in the day of revolt.</p>

<p>At a period when, for the mass of mankind, ideas were
transmitted orally and travelled with these wanderers
along the roads, the nomads served as a link between
the human groups of various districts. It would be therefore
of great interest for the historian to know what were
these channels of the popular thought, what life was led by
those who filled such a function, what were their influence
and manners. We shall try to study the chief types of
this race, and shall choose them in England in the fourteenth
century, in a country and at an epoch when their social
importance was considerable. The interest which attaches
to them is of course manifold; the personality of these
pardoners, professional pilgrims, and minstrels, extinct
species, is in itself curious to scrutinize; but not more
so than their state of mind and the mode in which they
carried on their businesses, both reacting on the social condition
of a great people which had just been formed and
was acquiring the features and the character still its own
at the present day. It was the period when, thanks to the
French wars and the incessant embarrassments of royalty,
the subjects of Edward III and of Richard II gained
a parliament similar to that which we now see; the period
when, in religious life, the independence of the English
spirit asserted itself through the reforms of Wyclif, the
statutes for the clergy, and the protests of the Good
Parliament; when, in literature, Chaucer inaugurated
the series of England’s great poets, and instead of one
more commonplace dream, Langland, like Dante, gave
to his compatriots <i>Visions</i>; when, in short, from noble to
villein was felt a stir which led without excessive revolution
to that true liberty for which we, the French, had
long to envy our neighbours. This epoch is decisive
in the history of the country. It will be seen that in all
the great questions debated in the cloister,
in the castle, <span class="xxpn" id="p026">{26}</span>
or on the market-place, the part played by the wayfarers,
though scarcely visible at times, was not insignificant.</p>

<p>We must first examine the place of the scene, afterwards
the events that happened there; see what were
the roads, then what were the beings who frequented
them.</p>

<h3 class="h3chap">CHAPTER I
<span class="hbig">ROADS AND BRIDGES</span></h3>

<p class="pfirst">The maintenance of roads and bridges in England was
in the four­teenth cen­tury one of those charges which weighed, like
military service, on the whole of the nation. All landed proprietors
were obliged, in theory, to watch over the good condition of the
highways; their tenants had to execute the repairs for them. The
religious houses themselves, owners of property given in <i>frank
almoigne</i>, that is to say, with a purely charitable object, were
dispensed from every service and rent towards their benefactor, no
other charge being usually left but that of saying prayers or giving
alms for the repose of the donor’s soul. It remained, however, for
them to satisfy for public weal the <i>trinoda necessitas</i>, or triple
obligation, which among other duties consisted in the repairing
of bridges.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn2" id="fnanc2">2</a> <span
class="xxpn" id="p030">{30}</span></p>

<p>There existed in England a very considerable network
of roads, the principal of which dated as far back as the
Roman times. The province of Britain had been one of
those where the greatest care had been bestowed upon the
military and commercial ways by the Roman emperors.
“The network of roads in the island,” says Mommsen,
“which was uncommonly developed, and for which in
particular Hadrian did much in connection with the
building of his wall, was of course primarily subservient
to military ends; but alongside of, and in part taking
precedence over the legionary camps, Londinium occupies
in that respect a place which brings clearly into view
its leading position in traffic.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn3" id="fnanc3">3</a>
In many places are
yet to be found remnants of the Roman highways, the
more important of which were called in Anglo-Saxon
times, and since, Watling Street, Erming Street, the Fosse,
and Ikenild Street. “These Roman ways in Britain
have frequently been continued as the publick roads, so
that where a Roman military way is wanting, the presumption
is in favour of the present highroad, if that
be nearly in the same direction.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn4" id="fnanc4">4</a>
There are two reasons
for that permanence: the first is that the roads were
built by the Romans to supply needs which have not
ceased to be felt; being cut, for instance, from London
to the north through York; towards Cornwall along
the sea coast; towards the Welsh mines, &amp;c.; the
second reason is the way in which they were built. “A
portion of the Fosse Road which remains at Radstock,
about ten miles south-west of Bath, and was
opened in February, 1881, showed the following
construction: <span class="xxpn" id="p031">{31}</span></p>

<p>“1. Pavimentum, or foundation, fine earth, hard
beaten in.</p>

<p>“2. Statumen, or bed of the road, composed of large
stones, sometimes mixed with mortar.</p>

<p>“3. Ruderatio, or small stones well mixed with
mortar.</p>

<p>“4. Nucleus, formed by mixing lime, chalk, pounded
brick or tile; or gravel, sand, and lime mixed with clay.</p>

<p>“5. Upon this was laid the surface of the paved
road, technically called the <i>summum dorsum</i>.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn5" id="fnanc5">5</a></p>

<p>All Roman roads were not built with so much care
and in such an enduring fashion; they were, however,
all of them substantial enough to resist for centuries,
and they remained in use during the Middle Ages. Other
roads besides were opened during that epoch to provide
for new fortified towns and castles, and to satisfy the
needs of great landowners, religious or otherwise.</p>

<p>The keeping of roads and bridges in repair, the latter
included in the <i>trinoda necessitas</i>, was not considered as
worldly, but rather as pious and meritorious work before
God, of the same sort as visiting the sick or caring for the
poor;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn6" id="fnanc6">6</a>
men saw in them a true charity for a certain
category of sufferers, namely, travellers; this is why the
clergy submitted to it. The pious character of
this kind of <span class="xxpn" id="p032">{32}</span>
labour may suffice to prove that the roads were not so safe
or in such a good state as has been sometimes maintained.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn7" id="fnanc7">7</a>
The noblest outcome of the religious spirit prevalent in
the Middle Ages was that disinterested enthusiasm
which, as soon as some distress of humanity became
flagrant, created societies for help and rendered self-denial
popular. One of these distresses was seen, for
example, in the power of the infidel, and the Crusades
were the consequence. The forsaken condition of the
lowest classes in the towns was noticed in the thirteenth
century, and St. Francis sent for the consolation of the
neglected, those mendicant friars at first so justly popular,
and who so promptly fell into disrepute. After the same
fashion travellers were considered as sufferers deserving
pity, and help was given to them to please God. A
religious order with this end in view had been founded
in the twelfth century, that of the <i>Pontiff</i> brothers, or
makers of bridges (<i>pons</i>, bridge), which spread into several
countries of the Continent.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn8" id="fnanc8">8</a>
In France they built over
the Rhône the celebrated bridge of Avignon, which
yet preserves four arches of their construction; and the
one at Pont St. Esprit, which is still in use, nineteen out
of its twenty-five arches dating from the years 1265 to
1309 when it was erected. To break the force of such
a current as that of the Rhône they built, near together,
piers of oblong form, ending in a sharp angle at the
two extremities of their axis,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn9" id="fnanc9">9</a>
and
their masonry was
<span class="xxpn" id="p035">{35}</span> so solid that in many places the waters have respected
it to the present day, that is, for eight centuries. They
also had establishments on the banks of rivers, and
helped to cross them by boat. Their most memorable
accomplishment was, however, the replacing of the same
ferries and of short-lived, often dangerous timber bridges
by stone ones, the normal progression for river crossing
being, throughout ages, the ford, the ferry, the timber
bridge, the stone bridge. Laymen learnt the secret
of their art and in the thirteenth century began to take
their place. Bridges multiplied in France; many still
exist, such, for example, as the fine fourteenth-century
bridge at Orthez, the two at Limoges, of the thirteenth
century, one of them with its chapel, the beautiful bridge
at Cahors, where even the machicolated turrets which
formerly served to defend it are still preserved, restored,
it is true, by the clever but strong hand of Viollet
Le Duc.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn10" id="fnanc10">10</a></p>

<div class="dcaption">5. THE OLD BRIDGE AT AVIGNON.
<div class="fsz6">(<i>Twelfth Century; present state.</i>)</div>
</div></div>

<p>In England, as in France, wooden bridges had in most
cases preceded stone ones. The former were built of oak,
like the one over the river Lune, in the city of Lancaster,
for which we find John of Gaunt writing to “monsire
Adam de Hoghton, nostre chief forestier de Wyresdale,”
to hand to John Ermyte of Singleton, who had actually
paid for them, one hundred and twenty oak trees from
the said forest of Wyresdale, “selected among the properest
and aptest, such as the said John
will designate. And <span class="xxpn" id="p036">{36}</span>
mind not to fail to act thus, nor cause that the
before mentioned work be thereby delayed in any
way.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn11" id="fnanc11">11</a></p>

<p>There is no trace in England of establishments founded
by the Bridge Friars, but it is certain that there, as
elsewhere, the works for constructing bridges and highways
had a pious character. To encourage the faithful to take
part in them, Richard de Kellawe, Bishop of Durham from
1311 to 1316, remitted part of the penance for their
sins. The registry of his episcopal chancery contains
frequent entries such as the following: “Memorandum
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. his lordship grants forty days indulgence
to all who will draw from the treasure that God has given
them valuable and charitable aid towards the building
and repair of Botyton bridge.” Forty days are allowed
on another occasion for help towards the bridge and the
highroad between Billingham and Norton,<a class="afnanc"
href="#fn12" id="fnanc12">12</a> and forty days for the
<span class="xxpn" id="p039">{39}</span> great road from
Brotherton to Ferrybridge. The wording of this last decree
is characteristic:</p>

<p>“To all those, &amp;c. Persuaded that the minds of the
faithful are more ready to attach themselves to <i>pious
works</i> when they have received the salutary encouragement
of fuller indulgences, trusting in the mercy of God
Almighty and the merits and prayers of the glorious Virgin
his Mother, of St. Peter, St. Paul, and of the most holy
confessor Cuthbert our patron, and all saints, we remit
forty days of the penances imposed on all our parishioners
and others .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. sincerely contrite and shriven
of their sins, who shall help by their charitable
gifts, <i>or by their bodily labour</i>, in the building or
in the maintenance of the causeway between Brotherton
and Ferrybridge on which <i>a great many people pass</i>.”<a
class="afnanc" href="#fn13" id="fnanc13">13</a></p>

</div></div>

<p>Causeways, owing to the abundance of marshy ground,
since drained, were scarcely less needed than bridges
and were also considered a meritorious work. A passage
in Leland well shows what they consisted of, how much
wanted, and what a proper object they were, for generous
minded, pious benefactors: “This cawsey by Skipbridge
towards Yorke hathe a nineteen small bridges on it for
avoydinge and overpassynge carres cuming out of the
mores thereby. One Blackeburne, that was twys maior
of Yorke, made this cawsey and a nothar without one
of the suburbs of Yorke. This Blakeburn hathe a
solemne <i>obiit</i> in the Minstar of Yorke and a cantuari at
Richemond.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn14" id="fnanc14">14</a></p>

<p>Municipal bodies, as well as gilds, those lay brotherhoods
imbued with the religious spirit, took care also in many cases
of roads and bridges. The Gild of the Holy Cross in Birmingham,
founded under Richard II, did this, and their intervention was
most valuable, as the <span class="xxpn" id="p040">{40}</span>
Commissioners of Edward VI remarked two centuries later. The gild
then “mainteigned .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and kept in good reparaciouns two
greate stone bridges, and divers foule and daungerous high wayes,
the charge whereof the towne of hitsellfe ys not hable to mainteign.
So that the lacke thereof wilbe a greate noysaunce to the kinges
ma<sup>ties</sup> subjectes passing to and from the marches of Wales
and an vtter ruyne to the same towne, being one of the fayrest and
most proffittuble townes to the kinges highnesse in all the shyre.”<a
class="afnanc" href="#fn15" id="fnanc15">15</a></p>

<p>An example of municipal action can be found in the
Ordinances of Worcester, prescribing that “the Brugge
(bridge) may be overseyn at alle tymes for the surete of
the cite. And that the reparacion of the saide Brugge
be overloked by the chamberleyns every quarter.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn16" id="fnanc16">16</a></p>

<p>Whether Queen Mathilda (twelfth century) got
wetted or not, as is supposed, on passing the ford of
the river at Stratford-atte-Bow—that same village where
afterwards the French was spoken at which old Chaucer
smiled—certain it is that she thought she was doing a
meritorious work in constructing two bridges there.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn17" id="fnanc17">17</a>
Several times repaired, Bow Bridge was still standing
in 1839. The queen endowed her foundation, granting
land and a water-mill to the Abbess of Barking with a
perpetual charge thereon for the maintenance of the bridge
and the neighbouring roadway. When the queen died,
an abbey for men was founded at the same Stratford, close
to the bridges, and the abbess hastened to transfer to the
new monastery the property in the mill and the charge
of the reparations. The abbot had them
done at first, <span class="xxpn" id="p041">{41}</span>
then wearied of it, and delegated the care of them to
one Godfrey Pratt. He had built this man a house
on the causeway beside the bridge, and paid him an
annual grant. For a long time Pratt carried out the
contract, “getting assistance,” says an inquiry of Edward I,
“from some passers-by, but without often having recourse
to their aid.” He also received alms from travellers, and
his affairs prospered. They prospered so well that the
abbot thought he would withdraw his pension; Pratt
indemnified himself the best way he could. He set up
iron bars across the bridge and made all pay who passed
over, except the rich, for he prudently made exception
“for nobility; he feared them and let them pass without
molesting them.” The dispute only ended in the time
of Edward II; the abbot acknowledged his fault;
resumed the charge of the bridge, and suppressed the
iron bars, the toll, and Godfrey Pratt himself.</p>

<div class="dcaption">7. BOW BRIDGE AS IT STOOD BEFORE ITS
DEMOLITION IN 1839.<div class="fsz6"> (<i>From a print dated
1831.</i>)</div>
</div></div>

<p>This bridge, over which no doubt Chaucer must have
passed, was of stone, the arches were narrow and the
piers thick; strong angular buttresses strengthened them
and broke the force of the current; these formed at the
upper part a triangle or siding which served as a refuge
for foot-passengers, for the way was so narrow that a
cart sufficed to fill it. When it was pulled down in
1839, it was found that the method of construction
had been very simple. To ground the piers in the bed
of the river the masons had simply thrown down stones
and mortar till the level of the water
had been reached. <span class="xxpn" id="p042">{42}</span>
It was remarked also that the ill-will of Pratt or the abbot
or their successors must have rendered the bridge almost
as dangerous at certain moments as the primitive ford.
The wheels of the vehicles had hollowed such deep ruts
in the stone and the horses’ shoes had so worn the pavement
that an arch had been at one time pierced through.</p>

<p>No less striking as a case where pious motives caused
the building of a bridge is the contract of the thirteenth
century, by which Reginald de Rosels allowed Peter, Abbot
of Whitby, to erect a permanent bridge on the river Esk,
between his own and the convent’s lands. He pledged
himself in that act to permit to all comers free access to
the bridge through his own property. “For which
concession the aforesaid Abbot and convent have absolved
in chapter all the ancestors of the same Reginald of all
fault and transgression they may have committed against
the church of Whiteby and have made them participant of
all the good works, alms, and prayers of the church of
Whiteby.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn18" id="fnanc18">18</a>
Numerous other examples of the same sort
might be quoted; but it will be enough to add, as being
perhaps more characteristic of the times than all the rest,
the recommendations which Truth in the “Vision concerning
Piers the Plowman” makes to the wealthy English
merchants, the number of whom had so largely increased
during the fourteenth century. Truth bids them to do
several works of charity, which he considers of the highest
importance for their salvation; they ought, among other
things, to “amenden mesondieux,” that is, hospitals for
sick people and for travellers; to repair “wikked wayes,”
that is to say, bad roads; and also</p>

</div></div>

<p>The pious character of the bridges was also shown by
the chapels that stood on them. Bow Bridge was thus
placed under the protection of St. Catherine. London
Bridge had a chapel dedicated to St. Thomas of
Canterbury;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn20" id="fnanc20">20</a>
a roomy Gothic building of apsidal form,
with high windows and wrought pinnacles, almost
a church. A miniature in a manuscript, of which a
reproduction on a reduced scale is given at the beginning
of this chapter, shows it fixed on the middle pier, whilst
along the parapet are houses with gabled roofs, whose
storeys project and overhang the Thames.</p>

<p>This was a famous bridge. No Englishman of the
Middle Ages, and even of the Renaissance, ever spoke
but with pride of London Bridge; it was the great national
wonder; until the middle of the eighteenth century it
remained (with the exception of some small ones
which have disappeared as well as the narrow waters
that they crossed)<a class="afnanc" href="#fn21" id="fnanc21">21</a>
the only bridge of the capital. It
had been commenced in 1176, on the site of
an old wooden <span class="xxpn" id="p044">{44}</span>
structure, dating back to Saxon times,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn22" id="fnanc22">22</a>
by Peter Colechurch,
“priest and chaplain,” who had already once repaired the
wooden bridge. The whole nation was stirred by this great
and useful enterprise; the King, the citizens of London,
the dwellers in the shires endowed the building with lands
and sent money to hasten its completion. The list of
donors was still to be seen in the sixteenth century, on
“a table fayre written for posterity,”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn23" id="fnanc23">23</a>
in the bridge chapel.</p>

<p>A little while before his death in 1205 another had taken
the place of Peter Colechurch, then very old, as director of
the works. King John, who was in France, struck with
the beauty of the bridges of that country, and having heard
of the magnificent bridge of Saintes which lasted till the
middle of the nineteenth century, and which was approached
by a Roman triumphal arch, chose, as successor to Colechurch,
a Frenchman, called Isembert, “master of the
Saintes schools” (1202). Isembert, who had given proof
of his capacity in the bridges of La Rochelle and of
Saintes,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn24" id="fnanc24">24</a>
set out with his assistants, furnished with a royal
patent addressed to the mayor and inhabitants of London.
John Lackland therein vaunted the skill of the master, a
man, he said, “of both knowledge and honesty,” and
declared that the revenue arising from the houses that
he would build upon the bridge should be consecrated
for ever to the maintenance of an edifice “so necessary
for you and for all those passing thereby.”<a class="afnanc"

<div class="fsz6">(<i>As it stood about</i>
<span class="smmaj">A.D.</span> 1600.)</div>
</div></div>

<p id="p047">The bridge was finished in 1209, when four “worthy
mar­chants of Lon­don” had be­come “prin­ci­pall maist­ers
of that work.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn26" id="fnanc26">26</a>
It was fur­nished with houses, a chap­el,
and de­fen­sive tow­ers. It immediately became celebrated,
and was the admiration of all England. The Scot, Sir
David Lindesay, Earl of Crawford, having fallen out with
Lord Welles, ambassador at the Scottish Court, a duel
was decided on, and Lindesay chose London Bridge as
the place of combat (1390). He crossed the length of
the kingdom, supplied with a safe-conduct from King
Richard II, and the duel solemnly came off at the place
fixed in the presence of an immense concourse. The
first shock was so violent that the lances were shivered,
but the Scotchman remained immovable in his saddle.
The people, fearing for the success of the English
diplomat, shouted that his adversary was tied to his horse
against all rules. Hearing this Lindesay, by way of
reply, leapt lightly to the ground, with one bound
returned to the saddle and, charging his adversary anew,
overthrew and grievously wounded him.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn27" id="fnanc27">27</a></p>

<p>The houses built on the bridge were several storeys
high; they had cellars in the thickness of the piers.
When the inhabitants needed water they lowered their
buckets by ropes out of the windows and filled them
in the Thames. Sometimes they helped with their ropes
poor fellows whose boat had capsized: the arches were
narrow, and it was not uncommon in the dark for a
boat to strike against the piers and be dashed to pieces.
The Duke of Norfolk and several others were saved in
this manner in 1428, but some of their companions were
drowned. At other times the inhabitants themselves
had need of help, for it happened occasionally that the
houses, badly repaired, leaned forward and
fell in one <span class="xxpn" id="p048">{48}</span>
block into the river. A catastrophe of this kind took
place in 1481.</p>

<p>One of the twenty arches of the bridge, the thirteenth
from the City side, formed a drawbridge to allow boats to
pass,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn28" id="fnanc28">28</a>
and also to close the approach to the town; this was
the obstacle which in 1553 hindered the insurgents led
by Sir Thomas Wyatt from entering London. Beside
the movable arch rose a tower on the summit of which
the executioner long placed the heads of decapitated
criminals. That of the Lord Chancellor, Sir Thomas
More, bled for a time on the end of a pike on this tower
before it was redeemed by Margaret Roper, the daughter
of the thinker who had written—“Utopia.”</p>

<p>Travellers wondered at the gruesome sight. “In
London,” wrote Joseph Justus Scaliger, who visited
the city in 1566, “there ever were many heads on the
bridge. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I have seen there, as it were [masts]
of ships and at the top of them quarters of men’s
corpses.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn29" id="fnanc29">29</a></p>

<p>In 1576, this tower of sombre memories was splendidly
reconstructed; the new one, containing fine rooms,
flooded with light by innumerable windows, was entirely
of wood, carved and gilt, in the “paper worke” style
popular in Elizabeth’s time, censured by steady Harrison.
It was called “None-such House.” The heads of the
“traitors,” sometimes traitors, sometimes saints, were no
more to pollute a building so cheerful in aspect; they
were placed on the next tower on the Southwark side.
Four years after this change,
fashionable Lyly the <span class="xxpn" id="p049">{49}</span>
Euphuist ended one of his books with a triumphal praise
of England, its products, its universities, its capital, adding:
“Among all the straunge and beautiful showes, mee
thinketh there is none so notable as the Bridge which
crosseth the Theames, which is in manner of a continuall
streete, well replenyshed with large and stately houses on
both sides, and situate upon twentie arches, whereof
each one is made of excellent free stone squared, euerye
one of them being three-score foote in height, and full
twentie in distaunce one from an other.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn30" id="fnanc30">30</a></p>

<p>The same arrangement prevailed in the case of important
bridges in many countries. In Paris the “Notre Dame”
bridge had the appearance of a street with sixty-eight
houses built on it.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn31" id="fnanc31">31</a>
The bridge at Poissy<a class="afnanc" href="#fn32" id="fnanc32">32</a>
and others
were of the same sort, the most famous of those which
remain being the “Ponte Vecchio” in Florence.</p>

<p>Even at the time when Lyly praised London Bridge as
deserving a place among the
“straunge and beautiful <span class="xxpn" id="p050">{50}</span>
showes” of the city, and Stow described it as “a worke
verie rare,” the structure was giving more and more
frequent signs of decay. Ben Jonson describes a little
later his Pennyboy senior as minding</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>A
 curtesie no more then London-bridge</div>
<div class="dpp00">What arch was mended last.”<a
class="afnanc" href="#fn33" id="fnanc33">33</a></div>
</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">Upon which that sour-mouthed reformer of poetry,
and of bridges, William Gifford, observed in his day:
“Two hundred years have nearly elapsed since this was
written, and the observation still holds. This pernicious
structure has wasted more money in perpetual repairs than
would have sufficed to build a dozen safe and commodious
bridges, and cost the lives, perhaps, of as many thousand
people. This may seem little to those whom it concerns—but
there is blood on the city, and a heavy account is before
them. Had an alderman or a turtle been lost there, the
nuisance would have been long removed.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn34" id="fnanc34">34</a></p>

<p>Without specifying whether it was out of fear of
Gifford, or interest in the aldermanic turtle, or perhaps
some higher motives too, the proper authorities took
radical measures as to the bridge in the first part of the
nineteenth century. An attempt was first made to preserve
it with the houses taken down, and broad, solid arches
replacing the old ones in the centre of the stream; it
had finally to be removed altogether. The present
bridge, built near the site of the old one, replaced
the “straunge and beautiful showe” of Lylyan days,
the “pernicious structure” of Giffordian ones, and was
opened to circulation in 1831, the expense having been
£1,458,311. It must now live five centuries more to
equal the longevity of its predecessor.</p>

<div class="fsz6">(<i>From a water-colour painting by C. Pyne.</i>)</div>
</div></div>

<p>This had been, all its life long,
an exceptional bridge, <span class="xxpn" id="p053">{53}</span>
with a biography of its own, worthy of a biographer, which
it got;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn35" id="fnanc35">35</a>
the others presented a less grandiose appearance.
People were even very glad to find bridges like the one
at Stratford-at-Bow, in spite of its want of width and its
deep ruts; or like the wooden bridge over the Dyke
with arches so low and narrow that all water traffic was
interrupted by any slight rising of the level of the water.
The state of this last bridge, which, in truth, was more
of a hindrance than a help to communications, at length
excited the indignation of neighbouring counties. During
the fifteenth century, it was granted, therefore, to the
inhabitants upon their pressing request, that they might
reconstruct the bridge, with a movable arch for boats.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn36" id="fnanc36">36</a></p>

<p>In the same way disappeared, also in the fifteenth
century, a bridge described by Leland in his “Itinerary”
as having been a “poore bridge of tymber and no causey
to come to it,” which crossed the Avon at Stratford. It
was in such a state that “many poore folkys and othar
refusyd to cum to Stratford when Avon was up, or cominge
thithar stoode in jeoperdy of lyfe.” The rich Sir
Hugh of Clopton, sometime mayor of London, who was
born at Clopton near Stratford, and died in 1497,
moved by the danger of his compatriots, and “having
never wife nor children, convertid a great peace of his
substance in good workes in Stratford, first making a
sumptuus new bridge and large of stone, wher in the
middle be a vi great arches for the maine streame of Avon
and at eche ende certen smaul arches to bere the causey,
and so to passe commodiously at such tymes as the ryver
risith.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn37" id="fnanc37">37</a>
This same bridge is still in use, and well deserves
the praise bestowed upon it by Leland. But
fine as it <span class="xxpn" id="p054">{54}</span>
is, one would have less regretted its disappearance than the
destruction of a “praty house of bricke and tymbre,”
built by the same Hugh of Clopton with the purpose
of ending his days in it. That house was purchased afterwards—also
with the intent of ending his life in it—by
a certain countryman of Hugh, who has since become
famous enough, William Shakespeare, who repaired the
house, then called New Place, and died in it in the year
1616.</p>

<p>The calling in of the foreign cleric Isembert to superintend
the works of London Bridge seems to have been
exceptional. The building of ordinary bridges was
usually entrusted to local craftsmen or masons; and it would
have been strange indeed if the people who could raise
such splendid cathedral naves all over England, had been
at a loss to span rivers with bridges. One of the few
indentures for the building of a bridge which have come
down to us concerns the re-construction of Catterick
bridge, Yorkshire, in 1422, on the great Roman road, the
Erming Street, and the contractors seem to have been
English. The document is curious in many respects.</p>

<p>The contract binds several authorities on the one
hand, and “Tho. Ampilforde, John Garette, and Robert
Maunselle, masons,” on the other. It is stated in it
“yat y<sup>e</sup> foresaides Tho., John, and Rob., schalle make
a brigge of stane oure (over) y<sup>e</sup> water of Swalle atte Catrik
be twix y<sup>e</sup> old stane brigge and y<sup>e</sup> new brigge of tree (of

accordand in substance to Barnacastelle brigge, aftir y<sup>e</sup>
ground and y<sup>e</sup> watyr accordes, of twa pilers, twa land
stathes (abutments), and thre arches.” The deed goes
on to give a minute account of the way in which every part
of the work must be performed, of the material that
will be used, and of the time when the bridge must be
entirely finished and open to
circulation: “And y<sup>e</sup> <span class="xxpn" id="p057">{57}</span>

receive in payment, at certain fixed dates, “gounes,”
and also sums of money, the total of which will be 260
marks sterling.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn38" id="fnanc38">38</a></p>

</div></div>

<p>The bridge built by the three masons, John, Thomas,
and Robert, is still in existence, but it has undergone
great and grievous alterations.</p>

<p>We have already seen some examples of the means
employed at this period to secure the maintenance of
these valuable constructions, when that maintenance had
to be ensured by something more than the charges incident
to the ownership of the neighbouring lands (<i>trinoda necessitas</i>);
we know that it was sometimes provided through
“indulgences” promised to benefactors, sometimes by
the action of gilds, or municipalities, sometimes also by
the endowments with which one of the great would enrich
the bridge founded by him. But without speaking of
occasional gifts,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn39" id="fnanc39">39</a>
several other methods were employed
with success, even with profit, such as the lawful
levying of those tolls which Godfrey Pratt had arbitrarily
imposed on his fellow citizens, or the collection of pious
offerings made at the chapel of the bridge and to its
warden. The right of toll was called <i>brudtholl</i> (bridgetoll)
or <i>pontagium</i>; the grantee, to whom the benefit went,
bound himself in return to make all the necessary repairs.
Sometimes the King accorded the right as a favour during
a certain period, as appears, for
example, from the <span class="xxpn" id="p058">{58}</span>
following petition, which is of the time of Edward I or
Edward II:</p>

<div class="dblockquote">
<p>“To our lord the king, prays his vassal William of
Latymer lord of Yarm,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn40"
id="fnanc40">40</a> that he will grant him pontage for
five years at the bridge of Yarm, which is broken down,
where men were wont to pass with carts and with horses
on the king’s highway between the water of Tees towards
Scotland. May it please him to do this for the soul of
Madame his consort, who is to God commended, and for the
common profit of the people who pass.” The King’s reply was
favourable: “The King grants the pontage for the term.”<a
class="afnanc" href="#fn41" id="fnanc41">41</a></p></div>

<p>Some of the tariffs in force at certain bridges during
the fourteenth century have come down to us and have
been printed; the most detailed of these is of the year
1306, and concerns London Bridge. It is annexed to a
patent of Edward I, and enumerates not only passengers,
carriages, and animals of every quality or description,
but also every sort of “saleable” ware which may pass
either on or under the bridge: though it may seem somewhat
unfair to have drawn money from shipmen towards
the expenses of a structure that was their most formidable
competitor.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn42" id="fnanc42">42</a>
This list, which is a great help
in forming an exact idea of
the commodities brought <span class="xxpn" id="p059">{59}</span>
to London by land or by river, covers no less than four
pages of printed matter: including coal, timber, beer,
wines, horses, cattle, pigs, grain, sheep, butter and cheese,
fish, furs and skins, metal pots and cups, millstones, silk
and other cloths, etc.; the place they come from is sometimes
mentioned: Northampton, Flanders, Normandy.</p>

<p>Another very curious petition (1334) will show the
use of the other mode, that is, the collection of voluntary
offerings from charitable passers-by. The share of the
clergy in the care of these buildings, the greediness with
which the profitable right of collecting the gifts was
disputed, and the embezzlements sometimes resulting
therefrom are to be noticed:</p>

<div class="dblockquote">
<p>“To our lord the king and his Council showeth their
poor chaplain, Robert le Fenere, parson of the church of St.
Clement, of Huntingdon, of the diocese of Lincoln, that
there is a little chapel lately built in his parish on the
bridge of Huntingdon, the keeping of which chapel our
lord the king has granted and delivered during pleasure
to one Sir Adam, warden of the house of St. John of
Huntingdon, who receives and takes away all manner
of offerings and alms without doing anything for the
repair of the bridge or of the said chapel as he is bound
to do. On the other hand, it seems hurtful to God and
Holy Church that offerings should be appropriated to
any one except to the parson within whose parish the
chapel is founded. Wherefore the said Robert prays,
for God and Holy Church and for the souls of our lord
the king’s father and his ancestors, that he may have the
keeping of the said chapel annexed to his church, together
with the charge of the bridge, and he will take heed with
all care to maintain them well, with better will than any
stranger, for the profit and honour of Holy Church,
to please God and all people passing that way.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn43" id="fnanc43">43</a></p></div>

<p id="p060">This jumble of human and divine interests (from
the birthplace, that was to be, of Oliver Cromwell)
was submitted to the usual examination, and the request
was set aside, with the following note: “Non
est peticio parliamenti”; it is not a petition for
Parliament.</p>

<p>In many cases, the bridge was itself at once proprietor
of real estate and beneficiary of the offerings made
to its chapel, and sometimes also grantee of a right of
toll; it had income from both civil and religious sources.
Such were notably the bridges of London, of Rochester,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn44" id="fnanc44">44</a>
of Bedford, and many others. John de Bodenho,
chaplain, explains to Parliament that the inhabitants
of Bedford hold their own town at farm from the king,
and have undertaken to maintain their bridge. For
this they “assigned certain tenements and rents in the
said town to support it, and with their alms have newly
built an oratory on the side of the water belonging to
Lord Mowbray, by leave of the lord, adjoining the said
bridge.” The burgesses gave to the plaintiff the charge
of the reparations, together with the whole revenues.
But the priest, John of Derby, represented to the king
that it was a royal chapel which he might dispose of,
and the king has given it to him, which is very unjust,
since the chapel is not the king’s; even those who founded
it are still living. All these reasons were found good;
the judges were ordered to grant the
plaintiff’s plea, and <span class="xxpn" id="p061">{61}</span>
were reprimanded for not having done it sooner, as had
already been prescribed to them.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn45" id="fnanc45">45</a></p>

<p>Enriched by so many offerings, protected by the
<i>trinoda necessitas</i>, and by the common interest of the landed
proprietors, these bridges should have been continually
repaired, and have remained sound. But there was nothing
of the sort, and the distance between legal theory and
actual practice was great. When the taxes were regularly
collected and honestly applied, they usually sufficed
to support the building; even the right of collecting
them, being in itself profitable, was, as has been seen,
strongly contested for; but the example of Godfrey
Pratt and of some others has already shown that all the
wardens were not honest. Many, even in the highest
positions, imitated Godfrey. London Bridge itself, so
rich, so useful, so admired, was in constant need of repairs,
never done until danger was imminent, or even
a catastrophe had happened. Henry III granted the
farm of the bridge revenues “to his beloved wife,” who
neglected to maintain it, and appropriated to herself
without scruple the rents of the building; none the less
did the king renew his patent at the expiration of the term,
that his said beloved might benefit “from a richer favour.”
The result was not long awaited; it was soon found
that the bridge was in ruins, and to restore it the
ordinary resources were not enough; it was necessary
to send collectors throughout the country to gather offerings
from those willing to give. Edward I, in January
1281, begged his subjects to hasten; the bridge would
give way if they did not send prompt assistance. He
ordered the archbishops, bishops, all the clergy, to allow
his collectors to address the people freely with “pious
exhortations,” that the subsidies should be craved without
delay. But nevertheless the supplies arrived too
late; the catastrophe had already
happened, a “sudden <span class="xxpn" id="p062">{62}</span>
ruin” had befallen the bridge, and to repair this misfortune
the king established a special tax upon the
passengers, merchandise and boats (February 4, 1282),
which tax was imposed again and the new tariff afore
mentioned was put into force on May 7, 1306. What
this sudden ruin was we learn from Stow’s “Annales”;
the winter had been very severe, the frost and snow
had caused great cracks in the floor of the bridge, so that
towards the Feast of the Purification (February 2), five
of the arches fell in. Many other bridges, too, in the
country had suffered damage, Rochester Bridge had even
entirely fallen.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn46" id="fnanc46">46</a></p>

<p>It may be imagined what fate awaited unendowed
country bridges. The alms from the passers-by proved
insufficient, so that little by little, nobody repairing them,
the arches wore through, the parapets were detached,
not a cart passed but fresh stones disappeared in the river,
and soon carriages and riders could not venture without
danger over the half demolished building. If moreover
a flood should occur, all was over with the bridge
and often with the imprudent or hurried travellers who
might be crossing late in the evening. An accident
of this kind was brought up for his justification by
a chamberlain of North Wales, from whom Edward III
claimed a hundred marks. The chamberlain averred
that he had duly sent the money by his clerk, William
of Markeley; but, alas, “the said William was drowned
in Severn, at Moneford bridge, by the rising flood of
water, and could not be found, so that he was devoured
by beasts; thus the said hundred marks
chanced to be <span class="xxpn" id="p063">{63}</span>
lost.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn47" id="fnanc47">47</a>
At that time there were still wolves in England,
and the disappearance of the body, with the 100 marks,
though even then wolves did not feed on marks, would
appear less unlikely than at present.</p>

<p>In those days neglect attained a degree now impossible
and which we can scarcely imagine. The Commons of the
counties of Nottingham, Derby, and Lincoln, and of the town
of Nottingham, declare to the Good Parliament of 1376,
that there is near the town of Nottingham a great bridge
over the Trent, called Heybethebridge, “to the making
and repair of which nobody is bound and alms only are
collected, by which bridge all the comers and goers between
the north and the south parts should have their
passage.” This bridge is “ruinous,” and “oftentimes
have several persons been drowned, as well horsemen
as carts, man, and harness.” The complainants pray
for power to appoint two bridge wardens, who shall
administer the property that will be given in view of its
maintenance, “for God and as a work of charity.”
But the king did not accede to their request.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn48" id="fnanc48">48</a></p>

<p>Or maybe it happened that the riverside proprietors
let their obligation fall into oblivion, even when it
was at the beginning formal and precise enough. The
legislator had, however, taken some precautions; he had
inscribed bridges on the list of the articles for those
inquiries periodically opened in England by the justices
in Eyre, sheriffs and bailiffs, as we shall see further
on<a class="afnanc" href="#fn49" id="fnanc49">49</a>; but
those concerned found means to defraud the law. People had
been so long used to see ruin menace the edifice, that
when it actually did give way no one could say who ought
to have repaired it. It then became <span class="xxpn"
id="p064">{64}</span> necessary to apply to the king for
a special inquiry, and to seek on whom lay the service.
Parliament thus decides in 1339, on the demand of the prior
of St. Neots: “<i>Item</i>, let there be good and true men
assigned to survey the bridge and causeway of St. Neots,
whether they be broken down and carried away by the rising
of the waters, as the prior alleges, or not. And in case
they are broken down and carried away, to inquire who ought
and was used to have it repaired, and who is bound of right
to do it; and how the bridge and roadway may be re-made
and repaired. And what they<a class="afnanc" href="#fn50"
id="fnanc50">50</a> find they shall return into the
chancery.”</p>

<p>In consequence of such inquests the persons charged
with the maintenance being determined by the findings
of a jury convened on the spot, a tax is levied upon them
for the carrying out of the repairs. But they often protest
and refuse to pay; they are sued, they appeal to the king;
horse, cart, anything that may come to hand and which
belongs to them is promptly seized to be sold for the
benefit of the bridge; the dispute drags on, and meanwhile
the edifice gives way. Hamo de Morston, for
example, in the eleventh year of Edward II, complains
that his horse has been taken from him. Called to
justify themselves, Simon Porter and two others who
have made the seizure, explain that there is a bridge at
Shoreham, called the Long bridge, which is half destroyed;
now it has been found that the building ought to be
restored at the expense of the tenants of the Archbishop
of Canterbury. Hamo, who is one of them, having
refused to pay his part of the contribution, Simon and
the others took the horse. They acted by order of a
bailiff, and their conduct is vindicated. Another case
of the same period is that of the Abbot of Coggeshall
who, after a similar inquest, refused
to execute any <span class="xxpn" id="p065">{65}</span>
repairs to a bridge near his lands under pretext that
within memory of man there had been no other bridge
over the river “than a certain plank of board,” and
that at all times it had been found sufficient for horsemen
and pedestrians. Innumerable are the examples of
inquests of this sort and of the difficulties in executing
the measures decided on.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn51" id="fnanc51">51</a></p>

<p>Owing to these several causes the chronicle-history
of even the most important English bridges, when it
is possible to trace it, is a long tale of crumblings
into the river, rebuildings, and repairs, and ever-recurring
catastrophes. Sometimes when the damage was great,
and much money was needed and was not forthcoming,
a ferry was established as a substitute for the late bridge,
and remained in use for years and years together.</p>

<p>Such a series of events is offered by the history of the
bridge on the Tweed at Berwick, which was one of the
longest in England. The first time we hear of it is in
the year 1199, and the news is that it gave way at that
date, owing to a rise of the river. It was rebuilt and gave
way again. Sometimes it was rebuilt of wood and sometimes
of stone; occasionally it fell altogether from end
to end, and then a ferry was established, and was maintained
for a long period. This was the case in 1294,
when great harm was done by the inundations. “Where
the bridge fell at this time,” says the latest historian of
Berwick, “there it lay for many years. The only method
of crossing was by ferry boats, worked from both
sides of the river; while the ferry in times of danger
was defended by soldiers. Thus, in Sir Robert Heron’s
(the controller) ‘Book of Bills’ for 1310, there is
allowed one half quarter of pease to each of six crossbowmen
(one of them being John Sharp Arewe) guarding
the ferry of the Tweed at
Berwick.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn52" id="fnanc52">52</a>
The ferry <span class="xxpn" id="p066">{66}</span>
follows vicissitudes scarcely less numerous than the bridge
itself, and disputes arise as to the right of working it,
or rather of collecting its tolls. The revenues of the
bridge, now that there is no longer any bridge, are also
a matter of difficulty, and the king has to interfere to
settle the question of the rents of houses and of fisheries
belonging to the ruined monument.</p>

<p>In 1347 at last the citizens of the town began to think
seriously of rebuilding their bridge, and the king granted
them the right of collecting towards the expenses a toll
of sixpence on every ship entering their harbour. The
bridge was then rebuilt, but not in such a way as not
to fall again, which has since happened to it many times.</p>

<p>Not less doleful is the story of the bridge on the Dee
at Chester, of which we hear in the chronicles for the
first time in 1227 and 1297, on account of its being
carried away by the water,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn53" id="fnanc53">53</a>
and the same may be said
of many of the bridges of mediæval England, especially
the longer ones.</p>

<p>When rebuilding had to be done people generally
did not care to remove what remained of the old monument,
for which reason, when a bridge has broken down
in our time, it has been often found that it was made
of an accumulation of superimposed bridges. Of this
the bridge over the Teign, between Newton Abbot and
Teignmouth, rebuilt in 1815, is an example. It became,
in this case, apparent that four successive bridges at least
had been at various times erected with or over the remains
of previous constructions. Mr. P. T. Taylor, who investigated
the matter at that time, gave as his opinion
“that the last or upper work was done in the sixteenth
century, and that the red bridge had been built on the
salt marsh in the thirteenth century; since which time
there has been an accumulation of soil to the depth of
ten feet. He supposes the wooden bridge to
be as old <span class="xxpn" id="p069">{69}</span>
as the Conquest, and the white stone bridge to have been
a Roman work.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn54" id="fnanc54">54</a></p>

<div class="dcaption">11. THE CHAPEL ON THE BRIDGE AT WAKEFIELD.
<div class="fsz6">(<i>Fourteenth Century; present state</i>)</div>
</div></div>

<p>Given these circumstances, it is rather a matter of
surprise than otherwise to find that a good number of
mediæval bridges still subsist in England; the more so
as the nineteenth century has been a great destroyer of
bridges. The enormous increase of population and the
proportionate want of means of communication during
that period has proved fatal to many bridges, and
especially to the more famous and important ones which
had been built in the more largely populated districts.
Owing to such necessities London Bridge itself has disappeared,
and even the recollection of the long years,
during which it had been, so to say, a factor in English
history and associated with the life of the nation, could
not save it.</p>

<p>Many others had the same fate, or were, at least, as
at Norwich, Durham, Chester, Wakefield, Monmouth, and
elsewhere, partly rebuilt or enlarged, not always in such a
way as to retain much of their pristine appearance. For all
that, however, enough of them remain to give an accurate
idea of what they were, without having recourse merely
to descriptions or drawings in contemporary manuscripts.
None, it is true, can for elegance and completeness compete
with such bridges as are still to be found in France; for
example, with the magnificent thirteenth-century bridge
of <i>Valentré</i> at Cahors, of which a picture has been
given above (p.
<a href="#fig06" title="go to Illustration 6">37</a>). Those that remain are sufficient,
nevertheless, to testify to the skill of old English architects
in that branch of their art. As might have been expected,
these bridges abound chiefly in those parts of the country
where the increase of traffic and population has been the
least conspicuous, on roads little more frequented to-day
than in the Middle Ages, which then led to strong castles
or flourishing monasteries, and
only lead now to <span class="xxpn" id="p070">{70}</span>
ivy-clad ruins. For this reason they are more numerous in
some parts of Wales than anywhere in England.</p>

<p>In several cases the chapels which placed them under
the protection of a saint and where offerings were collected
have escaped the hand of the restorer and are still extant.
There is one, of the fifteenth century, at Rotherham, Yorkshire,
“a chapel of stone wel wrought,” says Leland<a class="afnanc" href="#fn55" id="fnanc55">55</a>;
another, a fine small one, is to be seen on the bridge
at Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire; a third, a very tall
structure, stands on the middle of the bridge at
St. Ives, Huntingdonshire; but the finest example by
far is the chapel on the bridge at Wakefield, both
chapel and bridge dating from the fourteenth century.
Leland mentions them as “the faire bridge of stone of
nine arches, under which runnith the river of Calder,
and on the east side of this bridge is a right goodly chapel
of our lady and two cantuarie preestes founded in it.”
This foundation was made about 1358; Edward III, by
a charter dated at Wakefield, settled “£10 per annum
on William Kaye and William Bull and their successors
for ever to perform divine service in a chapel of St. Mary
newly built on the bridge at Wakefield.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn56" id="fnanc56">56</a></p>

<p>In our century the bridge has been widened towards
the west, the arches being round on that side and having
been left Gothic on the other. The chapel, the foundations
of which rest on an island in the river, was
repaired in 1847, but its original style was carefully respected.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn57" id="fnanc57">57</a>
The greatest change is in the surroundings,
where nothing recalls either Dr. Primrose
or the clear <span class="xxpn" id="p073">{73}</span>
waters of Plantagenet times; and the smoke and refuse
of innumerable manufactures blacken the bridge, the
chapel, the river, and even the sky itself.</p>

<div class="dcaption">12. THE BRIDGE WITH A
 DEFENSIVE TOWER AT WARKWORTH, NORTHUMBERLAND.<div
 class="fsz6">(<i>Fourteenth Century; present state</i>.)</div>
</div></div>

<p>Several specimens also remain of bridges with the
triangular recesses we have mentioned, left on the top
of the piers for the safety of foot passengers. Among
many other examples may be quoted the beautiful fourteenth-century
bridge at Warkworth, Northumberland,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn58" id="fnanc58">58</a>
which also deserves notice for another characteristic much
more rarely to be met with, that is, the preservation of
the tower built at one end for its defence. Most of the
bridges of any importance were protected in this way,
which, as the country became quieter, was found useless;
the consideration that they were ornamental rarely sufficed
to prevent their being pulled down. Those at
Chester were removed in 1782–1784; those at York
were demolished with the bridge itself, of the thirteenth
century, at the beginning of the nineteenth; the
Durham one, built on Framwellgate Bridge, in 1760;
the beautiful fortified entrance to one of the two bridges
at Shrewsbury disappeared in the same century, as well
as the whole structure, with the picturesque old houses
it bore. It must be conceded that those towers were
sometimes very inconvenient. A witness of the fact told
me that, quite recently, a gipsy’s caravan was stopped at
the tower on Warkworth Bridge, being unable to pass
under it owing to the lowness of the arch. The pavement
had to be hollowed out to allow of the caravan’s proceeding
on its way.</p>

<p>The best example of a defensive tower is the machicolated
one at Monmouth, on the Monnow Bridge;
except for the opening of passages to be used by people
on foot, the fortified gate looks as it did
in the Middle <span class="xxpn" id="p074">{74}</span>
Ages. The bridge itself, familiar to the Monmouth-born
“Prince Hal” of Shakespeare, and of England, has,
been, however, widened, as at Wakefield and elsewhere.
The ribs of the ancient arches are still visible within the
modern ones.</p>

<p>In Elizabethan times defensive towers for bridges
continued to be built, but in poetry only. Spenser raised,
in his lines, a beautiful structure, of Doric style, as befitted
the Renaissance days in which he lived, at the entrance
to the island of Venus:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpp01">It was a bridge ybuilt in goodly wize,</div>
<div class="dpp01">With curious corbes and pendants graven faire,</div>
<div class="dpp01">And arched all with porches, did arize</div>
<div class="dpp00">On stately pillours, fram’d after the Doricke guize.</div>
</div><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpp00">And for defence thereof, on th’ other end</div>
<div class="dpp01">There reared was a castle faire and strong,</div>
<div class="dpp01">That warded all which in and out did wend,</div>
<div class="dpp01">And flancked both the bridges sides along.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn59" id="fnanc59">59</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>But, except as castles in the air, such fortifications
were no longer in demand.</p>

<p>The rarest of all bridges are, nowadays in England,
those having houses on them, as was the fashion in the
Middle Ages. The picturesque High Bridge at Lincoln,
originally built in the 12th century, still preserves
the lodgings built over it<a class="afnanc" href="#fn60"
id="fnanc60">60</a>; a solitary house remains on Elvet
Bridge at Durham, and the only bridge of some length, with
a complete row of houses, is a com­par­a­tive­ly recent one,
being the familiar Pulteney Bridge built at Bath by William
Pulteney in the eighteenth century. <span class="xxpn"
id="p075">{75}</span></p>

<div class="dcaption">13. THE DEFENSIVE TOWER ON THE MONNOW BRIDGE,
MONMOUTH.</div></div>

<span class="xxpn" id="p077">{77}</span>

<p>The more numerous of the mediæval bridges still in
existence are those of one arch; there are many of them
in Wales, some being most elegant and picturesque, such
as the famous Devil’s Bridge over the Mynach, near Aberystwith.
In England the largest is the one over the moat
of Norwich Castle; and the most curious the three-branched
one at Crowland, this last belonging in its
actual state to the fourteenth century. It is no longer
used, as no road passes over it and no water under.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn61" id="fnanc61">61</a>
Another
of the finest, and one of the least known, crosses the Esk,
near Danby Castle, Yorkshire. Its date is about 1385;
the arms of Neville, Lord Latimer, who had it built, are
yet to be seen at the top of the parapet.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Lastly, a word may be said of the
larger bridges, most <span class="xxpn" id="p078">{78}</span>
of which have unfortunately undergone great alterations
and repairs. Besides the Wakefield Bridge above mentioned,
there is one over the Dee, at Chester, part of
which is as old as the thirteenth century, thoroughly
repaired since Ormerod disrespectfully described it as
“a long fabric of red stone extremely dangerous and
unsightly.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn62" id="fnanc62">62</a>
At Durham there are the Framwellgate
and Elvet bridges, both originally built in the twelfth
century. A six-arched bridge, rebuilt in the fifteenth
century, exists at Hereford; another, repaired in 1449,
with the help of indulgences, remains at Bidford.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn63" id="fnanc63">63</a>
A
four-arched one, built in the fourteenth century, over
the Dee is to be seen at Llangollen, being “one of the
<i>Tri Thlws Cymru</i>, or three beauties of Wales;”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn64" id="fnanc64">64</a>
the
arches are irregular in size, for the builder, in this and
many other cases, minding more the solidity of the structure
than its regularity, erected the piers at the places
where the presence of rocks in the bed of the river
made it most convenient. A very noteworthy one is the
thirteenth-century bridge over the Nith, at Dumfries, in
Scotland, which had formerly thirteen arches, seven of
which only are now in use. It was long considered the
finest after that of London. Other mediæval bridges of
several arches remain at Huntingdon,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn65" id="fnanc65">65</a>
at St. Ives, at Norwich
(Bishop’s Bridge), at Potter Heigham (a most picturesque
one), at Tewkesbury, etc.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn66" id="fnanc66">66</a>
The Tewkesbury one,
with the middle arch enlarged in modern
times, but the <span class="xxpn" id="p079">{79}</span>
triangular recesses for foot passengers still in use, dates
back to King John, <i>teste</i> Leland, whose biography of
the bridge shows that it went through the vicissitudes
usual in the life of such buildings: “King John beyng
Erle of Glocester by his wife caussid the bridge of Twekesbyri
to be made of stone. He that was put in truste to
do it first made a stone bridge over the gret poure of booth
the armes [of the Avon] by north and weste: and after,
to spede and spare mony, he made at the northe ende a
wodde bridge of a greate length for sodeyne land waters,
putting the residue of the mony to making of the castel
of Hanley&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>“King John gave to the mayntenance of this bridge
the hole tolle of the Wensday and Saturday markets in
the towne, the which they yet possesse, turnyng it rather
holely to their owne profit then reparation of the
bridge.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn67" id="fnanc67">67</a></p>

<p>The maintenance of the roads much resembled that
of the bridges; that is to say, it greatly depended upon
chance, opportunity, or the goodwill or piety of those to
whom the adjoining land belonged. In the case of roads,
as of bridges, petitions were sent to Parliament asking
that a tax be levied for the repair of the road upon
those who used it: an early attempt at the establishment
of that toll system which survived in England until
the highways were “disturnpiked” in the second half
of the nineteenth century. “Walter Godelak of Walingford,
prays for the establishment of
a custom to be <span class="xxpn" id="p080">{80}</span>
collected from every cart of merchandise using the road
between Jowermersh and Newenham, on account of the
depth and for the repair of the said way. <i>Reply</i>: The
King will do nothing therein.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn68" id="fnanc68">68</a>
Again, a lady arrogates
to herself the right to levy a tax on all comers: “To
our lord the King show the commonalty of the people of
Nottinghamshire passing between Kelm and Newur, that
whereas the King’s highway between the said two towns
has been wont to be for all persons freely to pass, on horseback,
in carts, and on foot from time immemorial, the
Lady of Egrum has got hold to herself of the said road
in severalty, taking from those passing along there grievous
ransoms and exactions, in disheritance of the King and his
crown and to the great hurt of the people.” The king
orders an inquest.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn69" id="fnanc69">69</a></p>

<p>Even a bishop would occasionally set a bad example,
though bound more than any to set a good one. The
inhabitants of Huntingdonshire and “the Island of
Ely” remonstrate in 1314–15, because the men of those
parts, either on foot or on horseback, have always used
the Horketh causeway, “which causway the bishop of
Ely is bound to repair and maintain, they say, for certain
rents which he gets; and the causway is broken by the
fault of the bishop, and the same bishop does not allow
ships to pass there under the bridge without levying a
heavy water tax (“theolonium”), which tax ought to be
applied to the reparation and maintenance of the same
bridge and causway, and they crave remedy.” An
inquest is ordered.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn70" id="fnanc70">70</a></p>

<p>Sometimes the sheriffs in their turns ordered the levy
of taxes on those who did not repair the roads; the law,
as we have seen, allowed it; but those who were fined
protested before Parliament under the
pretext that the <span class="xxpn" id="p081">{81}</span>
roads and the bridges were “sufficient enough”:—“<i>Item</i>,
humbly pray the Commons of your realm, as well
spiritual as temporal, complaining that several sheriffs
of your kingdom feign and procure presentments in their
turns that divers roads, bridges, and causways are defective
from non-reparation, with purpose and intent to amerce
abbots, priors, and seculars, sometimes up to ten pounds,
sometimes more, sometimes less, and levy the said amercements
by their officers called out-riders, without delay
or any reply of the parties, in places where the said roads,
bridges, and causeys are sufficient enough, or perhaps are
not in charge of the said amerced men.” <i>Reply</i>: “Let
the common law be kept, and the amercements reasonable
in this case.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn71" id="fnanc71">71</a></p>

<p>Where negligence began, the ruts, or rather the quags,
began. Those numerous little subterranean arches, which
the foot-passenger now does not even notice, made to
carry off rivulets dry during a part of the year, did not
exist then, and the rivulet flowed through the road. In
the East at the present day, the caravaneers talk in the
bazaars of the town about the roads and pathways; we
speak of them ourselves on returning home, as books of
travel show. There, however, a road is often nothing else
than a place along which men are accustomed to pass; it
little resembles the dignified highways the idea of which the
word road evokes in European minds. During the rainy
season pools of water cut off the ordinary track of the
horsemen and camels; they increase little by
little, and at <span class="xxpn" id="p082">{82}</span>
length overflow and form temporary rivers. At evening the
sun sets in the heavens and also in the empurpled road;
the innumerable puddles along the way, dotting the ground,
reflect the red flaming clouds; the wet horses and splashed
riders shiver in the midst of all these glimmerings, while
overhead and underfoot the two suns approach one another
to meet on the horizon. The roads of the Middle Ages
sometimes were like those of the modern East; the sunsets
were magnificent after showers, but to face long
journeys one had to be a robust horseman, inured to
fatigue, with unshakable health. The usual education and
training prepared people, it is true, for all these trials.</p>

<p>The roads in England would have been entirely impassable,
and religious zeal would, no more than the
indulgences of the Bishop of Durham and his peers, have
been sufficient to keep them in condition, if the nobility
and the clergy, that is to say, the mass of the landed
proprietors, had not had an immediate and daily interest
in maintaining possible roads. The English kings had
had the prudence not to form great compact fiefs like
those which they themselves owned in France, and which
made of them such dangerous vassals. Their own example
had taught them, and, from the beginning, they are
found distributing to the shareholders in that great
undertaking, the Conquest, domains scattered in every
part of the island. This kind of chequered proprietorship,
still subsisting in the fourteenth century, was noticed by
Froissart: “And several times,” he says, giving an
account of a talk with his friend and patron, Edward le
Despenser,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn72" id="fnanc72">72</a>
“it happened that when I rode about the
country with him, <i>for the lands and revenues of the
English barons are here and there and much scattered</i>, he
called me and said: ‘Froissart, do you see that great
town with the high steeple?’ <span class="xxpn" id="p083">{83}</span></p>

<p>“&#x200a;‘Yes, my lord,’ I answered, ‘Why do you say so?’</p>

<p>“&#x200a;‘I say so because it should be mine, but there was
a bad queen in this country who took all from us.’</p>

<p>“And thus, on one occasion or another, did he show
me, here and there in England, more than forty such
places.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn73" id="fnanc73">73</a></p>

<p>The tragic fated Despensers were not alone in having
the lands which they owed to the prince’s favour sown
haphazard in every county; all the great of their rank
were in the same case. The king himself, with all his
court, as well as the landed nobility, ceaselessly went
from one country place to another,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn74" id="fnanc74">74</a>
partly from choice
and partly because they could not do otherwise. In
times of peace it was a semblance of activity that
was not displeasing, but especially it was an economical
necessity. All, however rich, were obliged, like landowners
of every age, to live upon the produce of their
domains, first of one, then of the other, and as they went
from place to place, it was very important for them to
have passable roads, where their horses would not stumble
and where their baggage wagons, which served for
veritable removals, might have a chance of not being
overturned.</p>

<p>Military necessity, Scottish wars, French wars, Welsh
or Irish wars had a similar effect, and so had, to a degree,
nowadays incredible, the kings’ passion for hawking.
They did not want to be stopped when following their
birds by a broken bridge, and they would order the
commonalty, whether or not it was bound to do so,
to make prompt repairs in view of their coming. Hence
Article 23 in the Great Charter, meant
to check this <span class="xxpn" id="p084">{84}</span>
propensity: “Let no community or man be constrained
to make bridges on rivers except those who were legally
bound from old to do so.” As late, however, as
October 6, 1373, we find that Edward III commanded
“the sheriff of Oxfordshire to declare that all bridges
should be repaired and all fords marked out with stakes
for the crossing of the King ‘with his falcons’ during
the approaching winter season.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn75" id="fnanc75">75</a></p>

<p>In the same way the monks, those vast-landed
husbandmen, were much interested in the proper
maintenance of the roads. Their agricultural undertakings
were of considerable extent; an abbey such as
that of Meaux, near Beverley, had in the middle of the
fourteenth century, 2,638 sheep, 515 oxen, and 98 horses,
with land in proportion.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn76" id="fnanc76">76</a>
Besides, as we have seen, the
care of watching over the good condition of the roads
was more incumbent on the clergy than on any other
class, because it was a pious and meritorious work.</p>

<p>All these motives combined were enough to provide
roads sufficient for the usual needs, but in those days people
were content with little. Carts and even carriages were
heavy, lumbering, solid machines, which stood the hardest
jolts. People of any worth journeyed on horseback, the use
of a carriage being exceptional. As to those who travelled
on foot, they were used to all sorts of misery. Little then
sufficed; and if other proofs were wanting of the state
into which the roads were liable to fall, even in the most
frequented places, we should find them in a patent of
Edward III of November 20, 1353, which orders the
paving of the highroad, <i>alta via</i>, running from Temple
Bar to Westminster. This road, being almost a street,
had been paved, but, the king explains, it is “so full
of holes and bogs .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the pavement
is so damaged <span class="xxpn" id="p085">{85}</span>
and broken,” that the traffic has become very dangerous
for men and carts. He orders, in consequence, each landowner
on both sides of the road to remake, at his own
expense, a footway of seven feet up to the ditch, <i>usque
canellum</i>. The middle of the road—<i>inter canellos</i>—the
width of which is unfortunately not given, is to be
paved, and the expense covered by means of a tax laid on
all the merchandise going to the staple at Westminster.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn77" id="fnanc77">77</a></p>

<p>Three years later a general tax was laid by the City
of London on all carts and horses bringing merchandise
or materials of any kind to the town. The regulation
which imposed it, of the thirtieth year of Edward III,
first states that all the roads in the immediate environs
of London are in such bad condition that the carriers,
merchants, etc., “are oftentimes in peril of losing what
they bring.” Henceforth, to help the reparations, a due
will be levied on all vehicles and all laden beasts coming
to or going from the city; a penny per cart and a farthing
per horse each way; reductions were granted in case of
constant traffic: a cart bringing sand, gravel, or clay,
paid only threepence a week. By an article the unfairness
of which had nothing exceptional, the richer were
made to pay less than the poorer: “But for the carts
and horses of great people and other folks that bring their
own victuals and other goods for the use and consumption
of their own hostels, nothing shall be taken.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn78" id="fnanc78">78</a></p>

<p>The environs of Paris about the same time presented roads
and bridges quite as badly kept as those in the neighbourhood of
London. Charles VI, in one of his ordinances, states that the
hedges and brambles have greatly encroached on the roads, and that
there are even some in the midst of which trees have shot up: <span
class="xxpn" id="p086">{86}</span></p>

<p>“Outside the said town of Paris, in several parts of
the suburbs, <i>prévosté</i> and <i>vicomté</i> of the same, there are
many notable and ancient highways, bridges, lanes, and
roads, which are much injured, damaged, or decayed
and otherwise hindered, by ravines of water and great
stones, by hedges, brambles, and many other trees which
have grown there, and by many other supervening hindrances,
because they have not been maintained and
provided for in time past; and they are in such a
bad state that they cannot be securely used on foot
or horseback, nor by vehicles, without great perils and
inconveniences; and some of them are entirely abandoned
because men cannot resort there.” The Provost
of Paris is ordered to cause the repairs to be made by
all to whom it pertained; and, if necessary, to compel
by force “all” the inhabitants of the towns in the neighbourhood
of the bridges and highways to help in the work.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn79" id="fnanc79">79</a></p>

<p>But what makes us understand better than ordinances
the difficulty of journeys in bad weather, and enables us
to picture to ourselves flooded roads resembling those
of the East in the rainy season, is the impossibility sometimes
acknowledged in official documents of responding
to the most important royal summons, owing to the inclemency
of the elements. Thus, for example, it might
happen that the bulk of the members called to Parliament
from all parts of England would fail at the appointed
day, for no other reason than bad weather having, as
the event showed, caused the roads to be impassable. The
record of the sittings of the second Parliament of the
thirteenth year of Edward III (1339) show that it was
necessary to declare to the few representatives of the
Commons and of the nobility who had been able to reach
Westminster, “that because the prelates,
earls, barons, and <span class="xxpn" id="p089">{89}</span>
other lords and knights of the shires, citizens and burgesses
of cities and boroughs were so troubled by the bad weather
that they could not arrive that day, it would be proper
to await their coming.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn80" id="fnanc80">80</a></p>

<p>Yet these members were not poor folks, they had good
horses, good coats, thick cloaks covering their necks up to
their hats, with large hanging sleeves falling over their
knees;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn81" id="fnanc81">81</a>
no matter: the snow or the rain, the floods or the frost,
had been the stronger. Battling against the weather that
hampered their journey, prelates, barons, or knights,
halted their steeds at some roadside inn, and as they
listened to the tap of the sleet on the wooden panels
closing the window, with their feet at the fire in the
smoky room while awaiting the subsidence of the waters,
they must have thought on the royal displeasure which soon,
no doubt, would show itself in the “painted chamber” at
Westminster. In short, though there were roads, though
land was burdened with service for their support, though
laws from time to time recalled their obligations to
the owners of the soil, though the private interest of
lords and of monks, in addition to the interest of the
public, gave occasion to reparation now and then, the
fate of the traveller in a snowfall or in a thaw was
very precarious. Well might the Church have pity on
him, and include him, together with the sick and the
captive, among the unfortunates whom she recommended
to the daily prayers of pious souls.<a class="afnanc"

<h3 class="h3chap">CHAPTER II
<span class="hbig">THE ORDINARY TRAVELLER AND THE
CASUAL PASSER-BY</span></h3>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="pfirst">Thus kept up, the roads stretched away from the
towns and plunged into the country, interrupted
by rivulets in winter and dotted with holes;
the heavy carts slowly followed their devious course, and
the sound of creaking wood accompanied the vehicle.
These carts were numerous and in very common use.
Some were square-shaped timbrels, simple massive boxes
made of planks borne on two wheels; others, somewhat
lighter, were formed of slatts latticed with a willow trellis.
To add to their solidity, the wheels were studded with
big-headed nails.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn83" id="fnanc83">83</a>
Both sorts were used for
labour in the <span class="xxpn" id="p091">{91}</span>
country; they were to be found everywhere, and as they
abounded their hire was not expensive. Twopence for
carrying a ton weight a distance of one mile was the
average price; for carrying corn, it was about a penny
a mile per ton.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn84" id="fnanc84">84</a>
All this does not prove that the roads
were excellent, but that these carts, indispensable to agriculture,
were numerous. They did not cost much to
the villagers, who usually were the makers thereof; they
were built solid and massive because they were easier to
set up thus and resisted better the jolts of the roads; a
modest remuneration would suffice for their owners.
The king always employed a number; when he moved
from one manor to another, the brilliant <i>cortège</i> of the
lords was followed by an army of loud-creaking borrowed
carts.</p>

<p>The official purveyors found the carts wherever they
went and freely appropriated them; they exercised their
requisitions ten leagues on either side of the road followed
by the royal convoy. They even took without scruple
the carts of travellers who had come perhaps thirty or
forty leagues distance, and whose journey was thus abruptly
interrupted. There were indeed statutes against forced
loans, which specifically provided that suitable payment
should be made, that is to say, “ten pence a day for a
cart with two horses, and fourteen pence for a cart with
three horses.” But often no payment came. The “poor
Commons” renewed their protests, the parliament their
statutes, and the purveyors their exactions.</p>

<p>Besides the carts they required corn, hay, oats, beer,
meat; it was a little army that had to be fed, and the
requisitions caused the villagers painful apprehension.
People did what they could to be exempted; the simplest
way was to bribe the purveyor, but the poor could not.
Yet numberless regulations
had successively promised <span class="xxpn" id="p092">{92}</span>
that there should never be any further abuse. The king
was powerless; under an imperfect government, laws
created to last for ever rapidly lose their vitality, and those
made at that time died in a day.</p>

<p>Purveyors swarmed; impostors gave themselves out
as king’s officers who were not, and did not prove the
least greedy. All bought at inadequate prices and limited
themselves to fair promises of payment. The statute of 1330
shows how these payments never came; how also when
twenty-five quarters of corn were taken only twenty were
reckoned because they were measured by “the heaped
bushel.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn85" id="fnanc85">85</a>
In the same way, for hay, straw, etc., the
purveyors found means to reckon at a halfpenny what
was worth two or three pence; they ordered that supplies
of wine should be held in readiness for them, kept the
best for themselves in order to sell it again to their own
profit, and exacted payment for returning a part to
the original owners, which was a strange reversal of
things. The king acknowledged all these evils and
decreed reforms accordingly. A little later he did so
again, with no more result. In 1362 he declared that
henceforth the purveyors should pay ready money at
the current market price; and he gravely added, as an
important guarantee, that the purveyors should lose their
detested name and should be called buyers: “that the
heinous name of purveyor be changed, and named
achatour.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn86" id="fnanc86">86</a>
A word reform, if any.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn87" id="fnanc87">87</a></p>

<p>The same abuses existed in France, and numerous
ordinances may be read in the pages of Isambert, conceived
in exactly the same spirit
and corresponding to <span class="xxpn" id="p095">{95}</span>
the same complaints; ordinances of Philip the Fair in
1308, of Louis X in 1342, of Philip VI, who willed that
the “preneurs pour nous” (takers for us), should not
take unless they had “new letters from us,” which shows
the existence of false purveyors as in England. John of
France renews all the restrictions of his predecessors,
December 25, 1355, and so on.</p>

<p>The king and his lords journeyed on horseback for
the most part, but they had carriages too. Nothing
gives a better idea of the awkward, cumbersome luxury
which gave its splendour to civil life during this century,
than the structure of these heavy machines. The best
had four wheels, and were drawn by three or four horses,
one behind the other, one of them mounted by a postilion
provided with a short-handled whip of many thongs;
solid beams rested on the axles, and above this framework
rose an archway rounded like a tunnel;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn88" id="fnanc88">88</a>
an ungainly
whole. But the details were extremely elegant, the wheels
were carved and their spokes expanded near the hoop
into ribs forming pointed arches; the beams were painted
and gilded, the inside was hung with those dazzling
tapestries, the glory of the age; the seats were furnished
with embroidered cushions; a lady might stretch out
there, half sitting, half lying; pillows were placed in
the corners as if to invite sleep or meditation, square
windows opened on the sides and were hung with silk
curtains.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn89" id="fnanc89">89</a>
<span class="xxpn" id="p096">{96}</span></p>

<p>Thus travelled the noble lady, slim in form, tightly
clad in a dress which outlined every curve of the body,
her long slender hands caressing the favourite dog or bird.
The knight, equally tight in his <i>cote-hardie</i>, looked at her
with a complacent eye, and, if he knew good manners,
opened his heart to his nonchalant companion in long
phrases imitated from romances, themselves supposed to
imitate the language of his peers. The broad forehead
of the lady, who has perhaps coquettishly plucked out
some of her hair as well as her eyebrows, a process about
which satirists were bitter,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn90" id="fnanc90">90</a>
brightens up occasionally,
and her smile is like a ray of sunshine. Meanwhile
the axles groan, the horse-shoes crunch the ground, the
machine advances by fits and starts, descends into the
hollows, bounds all of a piece at the ditches, and comes
down with a heavy thud. The knight must speak pretty
loud to make his dainty discourse, Round Table flavoured,
heard by his companion. So trivial a necessity ever
sufficed to break the charm of the most delicate thought;
too many shocks shake the flower, and when the knight
presents it, it has lost its perfumed pollen.</p>

<div class="fsz6">(<i>From the Louterell Psalter.</i>)</div>
</div></div>

<p>The possession of such a carriage was a princely luxury.
They were bequeathed by will from one to another, and the
heirloom was valuable. On September 25, 1355, Elizabeth
de Burgh, Lady Clare, wrote her last will and endowed
her eldest daughter with “her great carriage <span
class="xxpn" id="p099">{99}</span> with the covertures,
carpets, and cushions.” In the twentieth year of Richard
II Roger Rouland received £400 sterling “for making the
Queen’s chariot”; and John le Charer, in the sixth of
Edward III, received £1,000 for the carriage of the Lady
Eleanor.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn91" id="fnanc91">91</a>
These were enormous sums. In the fourteenth century the
average price of an ox was thirteen shillings, one penny
farthing; of a sheep, one shilling and five pence; of a
cow, nine shillings and five pence; and a penny for a
fowl.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn92" id="fnanc92">92</a>
Lady Eleanor’s carriage thus represented the value of a
herd of sixteen hundred oxen.</p>

<p>Scarcely less ornamented were the horse-litters
sometimes used by people of rank, especially by ladies.
They were of the same shape as the carriages, being covered
with a sort of rounded vault, in which were cut more or
less large openings. Two horses carried them, one before,
the other behind, each being placed between the shafts
with which the contrivance was provided at both ends.<a
class="afnanc" href="#fn93" id="fnanc93">93</a></p>

<p>Between these luxurious carriages and the peasants’
carts there was nothing analogous to the multitude of
middle-class conveyances to which we are now accustomed;
the middle class itself being as yet but imperfectly
developed. True, there were some not
so expensive as <span class="xxpn" id="p100">{100}</span>
those belonging to the princesses of Edward’s Court,
but not many. Every one at this time knew how to ride
on horseback, and it was much more practical to use
one’s mount than the heavy vehicles of the period.
One went much faster, and was more certain to arrive.
“The Paston Letters” show that matters had changed
little in the fifteenth century. John Paston being ill
in London, his wife wrote asking him to return as
soon as he could bear the horse-ride; the idea of returning
in a carriage did not even occur to them. Yet
it was a serious case, “a grete dysese.”</p>

<p>Women were accustomed to riding almost as much
as men, and when they had to travel they usually did it
on horseback. A peculiarity of their horsemanship, which
we have seen of late becoming again the fashion after a
lapse of five centuries, was that they habitually rode astride.
The custom of riding sideways did not spread in England
before the latter part of the fourteenth century, and even
then it was not general. In the invaluable manuscript
of the Decretals in the British Museum,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn95" id="fnanc95">95</a>
ladies on horseback
are constantly represented, always riding astride.
At one place<a class="afnanc" href="#fn96" id="fnanc96">96</a>
horses are shown being brought for a knight
and a lady; both saddles are exactly the same; each
have tall backs, so as to form a sort of comfortable chair.
The numerous ivories of the fourteenth century in the
Victoria and Albert Museum and in the British Museum
often represent a lady and her lover, both on horseback,
and hawking. In almost all cases the lady unmistakably
rides astride. Both ways of riding are shown in the
fifteenth-century illuminations in the Ellesmere manuscript
of Chaucer’s “Canterbury Tales.” The wife of
Bath rides astride, with large spurs; the prioress sits
sideways.</p>

<div class="section">
<h4>II</h4>

<p>There were few places in England where the sight of
the royal train was not familiar. For the motives <span
class="xxpn" id="p104">{104}</span> mentioned above, the
Court’s journeys were incessant. The royal itineraries
that have come down to us throw a flood of light on this
continual need of movement. The itinerary of King John
shows that he rarely passed a month in the same place,
most frequently he did not even remain there a week.
Within a fortnight he is often found at five or six
different towns or castles.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn97"
id="fnanc97">97</a> The same with Edward I, who, as we have
seen, would change his abode three times every fortnight.<a
class="afnanc" href="#fn98" id="fnanc98">98</a></p>

<p>And when the king moved, not only was he preceded by
twenty-four archers in his pay, receiving threepence a
day,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn99" id="fnanc99">99</a>
but he was accompanied by all those officers whom the
author of “Fleta” enumerates with so much complacency.
The sovereign took with him his two marshals, his outer
marshal (<i>forinsecus</i>) who in time of war disposed
the armies for battle, selected the halting-places on
his journeys, and at all times arrested malefactors
found in the <i>virgata regia</i>, that is to say, within
twelve leagues around his dwelling;<a class="afnanc"
href="#fn100" id="fnanc100">100</a> and his inner marshal
(<i>intrinsecus</i>), who guarded the palace and castles,
and cleared them as much as possible of courtesans. He
collected from every common harlot (<i>meretrice communi</i>)
four pence by way of fine the first time that he arrested
her; if she returned she was brought before the steward,
who solemnly forbid her ever to present herself at the
dwelling of the king, queen, or their children; the third
time she was imprisoned and the tresses of her hair were
shorn off; <span class="xxpn" id="p107">{107}</span>
the fourth time one of those hideous punishments was
resorted to which the Middle Ages in their brutality
tolerated; the upper lip of these women was cut off, “ne
de cætero concupiscantur ad libidinem.”<a class="afnanc"
href="#fn101" id="fnanc101">101</a> There was also the
chamberlain, who took care that the interior of the house
was comfortable: “He has to arrange decently for the king’s
bed, and to see that the rooms be furnished with carpets
and benches;” the treasurer of the wardrobe, who kept the
accounts; the marshal of the hall, whose mission it was
to eject unworthy intruders and dogs,—“non enim permittat
canes aulam ingredi,”—and a crowd of other officers.<a
class="afnanc" href="#fn102" id="fnanc102">102</a></p>

</div></div>

<p>Overtopping all the rest, there was, moreover, the
king’s seneschal or steward, first officer of his household,
and his great justiciary. Wherever the king went
the apparatus of justice was transported with him; when
he was about to start the steward gave to the sheriff notice
of the place where the Court would stop, in order that he
might bring his prisoners to the town where the prince
was to be stationed.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn103" id="fnanc103">103</a>
All the cases amenable to the jurisdiction
of the justices in eyre were then determined by
the steward, as the king’s justiciary, who prescribed, if
necessary, the judicial duel, pronounced sentences of
outlawry, and judged in criminal and
civil cases.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn104" id="fnanc104">104</a>
This <span class="xxpn" id="p108">{108}</span>
right of criminal justice even accompanied the king abroad,
but he only exercised it when the criminal had been arrested
in his own royal place of abode. One such case happened
in the fourteenth year of the reign of Edward I. This
sovereign being at Paris, Ingelram de Nogent came into
his house to steal, and was caught in the act. After some
discussion it was acknowledged that Edward, by his royal
privilege, should remain judge in the matter; he delivered
the robber over to Robert Fitz-John, his steward, who
caused Ingelram to be hung from the gibbet of St.
Germain-des-Prés.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn105" id="fnanc105">105</a></p>

<p>For a long time the chancellor himself, and the clerks
who made out the writs, followed the king on his journeys,
and Palgrave notes that frequently a strong horse was
requisitioned from the nearest convent to carry the rolls;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn106" id="fnanc106">106</a>
but this custom came to a close in the fourth year of
Edward III, when the Chancery was permanently established
at Westminster.</p>

<p>The tribunal moving on, a crowd of suitors moved
with it. No matter though they were not inscribed on
the rolls, they followed without losing patience, as gulls
follow the ship, hoping that something may come their
way. Parties with a lawsuit, petitioners of every kind,
women “of ill life” (<i>de fole vie</i>), a whole herd of individuals
with no one to vouch for them, persisted in escorting
the prince and his courtiers. They quarrelled among
each other, robbed by the way, sometimes committed
murders, and, as may be imagined, did not contribute to
render the news of the king’s arrival welcome to his subjects.</p>

</div></div>

<p>In the ordinances of his household, Edward II enumerates
and deplores all these abuses; he orders that masterless
men who follow the Court shall be put in irons for
forty days on bread and water, and that the women of
ill life shall be likewise imprisoned and
branded with a <span class="xxpn" id="p111">{111}</span>
hot iron; he forbids his knights, clerks, squires, valets,
grooms, in short, all who accompany him, to bring their
wives with them, unless these have any post or employment
at Court, this host of feminine beings increasing
the chances of trouble. He also limits the number of
persons who should accompany the marshal, which had,
as will happen, increased little by little beyond all bounds.
His ordinances, like so many others in the Middle Ages,
were conspicuous for their wisdom, their minuteness, and
their prompt decay.</p>

<p>Justice did not travel only in the king’s suite. She
was peripatetic in England, visiting the counties in the
company of the royal itinerant judges and going from
hundred to hundred with that governor, military chief,
police magistrate, financial agent, the sheriff, a functionary
of great local, and sometimes tyrannical, power, appointed
and dismissed at will by the king during certain periods,
elected at others.</p>

<p>Both kinds, at fixed times, were on the move and caused
a considerable portion of the inhabitants to leave their
work, take to the road and be on the move too, in order
to come to the court that was to be held. Both kinds put
before the jurors a number of questions which the twelve
men had to answer under oath, some of those questions
being obviously quite uncomfortable to reply to.</p>

<p>The sheriff goes about the hundreds<a class="afnanc" href="#fn107" id="fnanc107">107</a>
in his shire
and holds the “view of frank pledge,” chiefly established
for the maintenance of that ancient system of enforced
solidarity which obliged, theoretically at
least, every male <span class="xxpn" id="p112">{112}</span>
to belong to a particular group of inhabitants of ten or
more (tithing), jointly responsible for the misdeeds of any
of their number in case the culprit cannot be found,
fined, jailed or hanged, according to the occasion. By
degrees the old “articles of the view,” greatly varying
from place to place,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn108" id="fnanc108">108</a>
had increased in number, and the
jurors had to answer as to a variety of smaller offences
often duplicating the justices’ own interrogatories.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn109" id="fnanc109">109</a></p>

<p>The “turns” or “tourns” of the sheriffs might,
according to the Great Charter, only take place twice a
year, not oftener, because their coming occasioned loss
of time and money to the sworn men and others who had
to leave home and attend the court, and to the king’s
subjects at whose houses these officers and their train went
to lodge.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn110" id="fnanc110">110</a>
In spite of institutions which, as we shall
see, had made the very men placed under the jurisdiction
of the sheriffs, bailiffs, etc. themselves the censors
of these same officials, abuses were numerous, the Commons
were ever complaining, and frequent statutes, one after
the other, denounced corrupt practices and stopped them—for
a time.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn111" id="fnanc111">111</a>
<span class="xxpn" id="p113">{113}</span></p>

<p>The itinerant justices’ inquiry covered a much larger
field; their “Articles of the Eyre,” or <i>Capitula Itineris</i>,
included every imaginable misdeed from highest to lowest,
from “crimen læsæ Majestatis,” above which nothing
could be imagined, to fishing by means of “kidels”
(weirs) or the using of nets to capture pigeons without
the owner’s permit.</p>

<p>Coming four times a year in accordance with Art. 18
of the Great Charter, sitting in the full court of the county,
growing in importance, while that of the sheriff as a judge
went diminishing and the system of the frankpledge was
falling into disuse, the itinerant justices submitted to the
jury a ceaselessly increasing number of questions, a whole
quire of them in the first half of the fourteenth century.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn112" id="fnanc112">112</a>
They asked what crimes, what misdemeanours, what
infractions against the statutes had come to their knowledge.
And in these minute interrogatories at every
moment came up the names of the sheriff, the coroner,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn113" id="fnanc113">113</a>
the bailiff, the constable, of all the royal functionaries,
whose conduct was thus placed under popular control.
Has any of these officers, says the judge, released some
robber, or counterfeiter or a clipper of coin? Has he
for any consideration neglected the pursuit against a vagabond
or an assassin? Has he unjustly received fines?
Has he been paid by men who wished to avoid a public
charge (for example, of being sworn as member of a jury)?
Has the sheriff claimed more than reasonable hospitality
from those in his jurisdiction, in tourns held too oft?
Has he come with more than five or
six horses? And <span class="xxpn" id="p114">{114}</span>
the juror was obliged in the same way to denounce,
under his oath, the great who had arbitrarily imprisoned
travellers passing through their lands, and all those who
had neglected to assist in arresting a thief and running with
the “hue and cry;”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn114" id="fnanc114">114</a>
for in this society each man is
by turns peace officer, soldier, and judge, and even the
humbler ones, menaced by so many exactions, have their
share too in the administration of justice and the maintenance
of public order. Highly important were, therefore,
from a social point of view, these judicial tourns, which
periodically reminded the mere man that he was a citizen,
and that the affairs of the State were also his affairs.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn115" id="fnanc115">115</a></p>

<p>Juries could at times, like so many other picturesque
groups of inhabitants, become one of the sights of the road.
If they perjured themselves or accepted bribes, they would
be sent to London and be jailed in the Tower; they were
to travel along, not by night, but “by clear day, in the
view of all, so that the country people might see the pain
and shame of those guilty men who will be thereby the
better punished.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn116" id="fnanc116">116</a></p>

<p>Or else, if that unanimity which became obligatory
in the latter part of the fourteenth century had not been
secured, the itinerant justices, in order to get
it any way, <span class="xxpn" id="p115">{115}</span>
were free to place the twelve men in carts and carry them
about wherever they went, until the twelve chose to agree.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn117" id="fnanc117">117</a></p>

<p>When monks came out of the cloister and travelled,
they wilfully modified their costume, and it became difficult
to distinguish them from the great. I saw, writes
Chaucer:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>I saugh
 his sleves purfiled atte hond</div>
<div class="dpp00">With grys, and that the fynest of a lond,</div>
<div class="dpp00">And for to festne his hood undur his chyn</div>
<div class="dpp00">He hadde of gold y-wrought a curious pyn,</div>
<div class="dpp00">A love-knotte in the gretter
 end ther was.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn118"
 id="fnanc118">118</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>But the councils are still more explicit, and do more
than justify the satire of the poet. Thus the Council of
London in 1342, reproaches the religious with wearing
clothing “fit rather for knights than for clerks, that is
to say short, very tight, with excessively wide sleeves,
not reaching the elbows, but hanging down very low,
lined with fur or with silk.” They made themselves
conspicuous by their long beards, rings on their fingers,
costly girdles, purses or bags whereon figures were embroidered
in gold, knives resembling swords, boots red
or party-coloured, or slashed long-pointed shoes (the Polish-born
poulaine); in a word, all the luxury of the
magnates of the land. Later, in 1367, the Council of
York renewed the same criticisms; the religious have
“ridiculously short” clothing; they dare publicly to
wear those coats “which do not come down to the middle
of the legs, and do not even cover the knees.” Severe
prohibitions were made for the future, though on a journey
tunics shorter than the regulation gown were tolerated.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn119" id="fnanc119">119</a></p>

</div></div>

<p>A bishop did not start on a journey without a great
train; and the bishops, besides
their episcopal visitations, <span class="xxpn" id="p116">{116}</span>
had, like the nobility, to travel to visit their lands and to
live on them. On all these occasions they took with them
their servants of different kinds and their followers, as
the king did his court. The accounts of the expenses
of Richard de Swinfield, Bishop of Hereford, give an idea
of the lordly life led by well-to-do prelates. He was a
bishop of some importance, and rich in proportion; many
manors belonged to his bishopric; he could hold his
rank as prelate and as lord, be hospitable, charitable to
the poor, and spend much on requests and suits at the
court of Rome and elsewhere. He had constantly in
his pay about forty persons of different ranks, the greater
part of whom accompanied him in his numerous changes
of residence. His squires (<i>armigeri</i>) had from a mark
(13s. 4d.) to a pound a year; his <i>valleti</i>, that is, the clerks
of his chapel and others, his carters, porters, falconers,
grooms, messengers, etc., had from a
crown to eight <span class="xxpn" id="p117">{117}</span>
shillings and eightpence. In the third category came the
kitchen servants, the baker, with two to four shillings a
year; in the fourth, that of the boys or pages who helped
the other servants, and whose wages greatly varied, being
from one to six shillings a year. All the household was
dressed alike, in striped cloth (<i>pannus stragulatus</i>), supplied
by the bishop, besides the fixed salary. One of the most
peculiar retainers of the bishop belonged to a now extinct
race, and was his champion, Thomas de Bruges, who
received an annual payment to fight in the prelate’s name
in case any lawsuit should have to be terminated by a
judicial duel.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn120" id="fnanc120">120</a></p>

<div class="section">
<h4>III</h4>

<p>At eventide, monks, great men, and travellers of all
degree sought shelter for the night. When the king,
preceded by his twenty-four archers, and escorted by his
lords and the officers of his household, was expected in
a town, the marshal selected a certain number of the best
houses, which were marked with chalk. The chamberlain
asked the inhabitants to make room, and the
Court settled as well as it could in the lodgings.
Even the capital was not exempt from the annoyance
of this burden; the marshal had,
however, to come <span class="xxpn" id="p118">{118}</span>
there to an understanding with the mayor, sheriffs, and
city officers for the selection of the habitations. Sometimes
the royal agent chose to forget this wise proviso,
and trouble followed. In the nineteenth year of Edward II,
that prince having come to the Tower, the people of his
household quartered themselves on the citizens without
the mayor and aldermen having been consulted; the
very sheriff’s house was marked with chalk. Great was
the wrath of this officer when he found Richard de Ayremynne,
the king’s own secretary, established in his house,
the stranger’s horses in his stable, his servants in the
kitchen. Undaunted by the thought of a royal secretary’s
importance, the sheriff, counting on the privilege of the
city, drove out the secretary and his suite by force, rubbed
off the marks of the chalk, and became once more master
of his own abode. Cited to appear before the Court
steward, and accused of having contemned the king’s orders
to the extent of at least £1,000, he stoutly defended himself,
and appealed in defence to the mayor and citizens,
who produced the charters of the city privileges. The
charters were clear, their purport could not be denied;
the sheriff’s boldness was excused; Ayremynne consoled
himself as best he could, and did not receive any indemnity.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn121" id="fnanc121">121</a></p>

<p>In the country, if the king did not happen to be within
easy reach of one of his own or his lieges’ castles, he often
went to lodge at the neighbouring monastery, sure of
being received there as master. The great on their journeys
did their best to imitate the prince in
this respect.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn122" id="fnanc122">122</a>
In <span class="xxpn" id="p119">{119}</span>
the convents hospitality was a religious duty; for the
order of St. John of Jerusalem the first of duties. This
order had establishments all over England, and it was
a piece of good fortune for the poor traveller to come to
one of them. No doubt he was treated there according
to his rank, but it was much not to find the door closed.
The accounts of the year 1338,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn123" id="fnanc123">123</a>
show that these knight-monks
did not seek at all to avoid the heavy burden of hospitality;
in their lists of expenditure are always to be found
charges occasioned by <i>supervenientibus</i> (strangers). When
it was an affair of kings or princes, they outdid themselves;
thus the Prior of Clerkenwell mentions “much
expenditure which cannot be given in detail, caused by
the hospitality offered to strangers, members of the royal
family, and to other grandees of the realm who stay at
Clerkenwell and remain there at the cost of the house.”
In consequence, the account closes with this sad summing
up: “Thus the expenditure exceeds the receipts by
twenty-one pounds, eleven shillings and fourpence.” The
mere proximity of a great man was a source of expense,
for, even if he did not go himself, he would send his suit
to profit of the hospitality of the convent. In the accounts
for Hampton, the list of people to whom beer and bread
have been furnished ends by these words: “because the
Duke of Cornwall is staying in the vicinity.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn124" id="fnanc124">124</a></p>

<p>It should be noted that most of these houses had been
endowed by the nobles, and each one, recognizing his
own land or that of a relative, a friend,
or an ancestor, <span class="xxpn" id="p120">{120}</span>
felt himself at home in the monastery. But these turbulent
lords, friends of good cheer, abused of the monks’ gratitude,
and their excesses caused complaints which came
to the ears of the king.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn125" id="fnanc125">125</a>
Edward I forbade any one to
venture to eat or lodge in a religious house, unless the
superior had explicitly invited him, or he were the
founder of the establishment, and even then his consumption
should be moderate. The poor only, who more than
any one lost by the excesses of the great, might continue
to be lodged for nothing: “The king intendeth not that
the grace of hospitality should be withdrawn from the
destitute.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn126" id="fnanc126">126</a>
Edward II, in 1309, confirmed these rules,
which had apparently fallen into abeyance, and promised
again, six years later, that neither he nor his family would
make inordinate use of the hospitality of the monks.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn127" id="fnanc127">127</a></p>

<p>All in vain; these abuses were already comprised
among those which the <i>Articles of the Eyre</i> had for their
object to discover, but failed to suppress. Periodically
the magistrate came to question the country folk on the
subject. Have “any lords or others gone to lodge in
religious houses without being invited by the superiors,
or gone at their own expense, against the will of the same?”
Have any been so bold as to “send to the houses or mansions
belonging to the monks or others, men, horses, or dogs
to sojourn there at an expense not their own?” The
application of these rules did not go without difficulty
or even danger, for the magistrate questioned also the
jury about “any who may have taken revenge for refusal
of food or lodging.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn128" id="fnanc128">128</a></p>

<p>The Commons in parliament, mindful as they were
in such matters of the fate of the poorest, were not unmindful
of their own, and took steps to prevent, in a
general way and without reference
to the impecunious, <span class="xxpn" id="p121">{121}</span>
the falling into disuse of monachal hospitality. The non-residence
of the clergy, which was to be one of the causes
of the Reformation two hundred years later, occasioned
bitter protests during the fourteenth century. The Commons
object especially because from this abuse there
results a decay of the duties of hospitality. “And that all
other persons advanced to the benefices of Holy Church,”
they request of the king, “should remain on their said
benefices in order to keep hospitality there, on the same
penalty, exception made for the king’s clerks and the
clerks of the great of the realm.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn129" id="fnanc129">129</a>
Parliament protests
also against the bestowal by the pope of rich priories
on foreigners who remain abroad. These foreigners
“suffer the noble edifices built of old time when they were
occupied by the English to fall quite to ruin,” and neglect
“to keep hospitality.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn130" id="fnanc130">130</a></p>

<p>Only people of high rank were admitted into the
monastery proper. The mass of travellers, pilgrims and
others, were housed and fed in the guest-house, a building
made on purpose to receive passers-by; it usually stood
by itself, and was even, sometimes, erected outside the
precincts of the monastery. Such, for instance, was the
case in Battle Abbey, where the guest-house is still to be
seen outside the large entrance gate. These edifices
commonly consisted of a hall with doors opening on each
side into sleeping rooms. People slept also in the hall;
old inventories, for instance the one concerning the
Maison-Dieu or hospital at Dover, show that beds were
set up in the hall and remained, it seems, permanently
there.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn131" id="fnanc131">131</a>
<span class="xxpn" id="p122">{122}</span></p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to recall that hospitality was
also exercised in castles; noblemen who were not at feud
willingly received one another; there were much stricter
ties of brotherhood among them than now exist among
people of the same class. We do not often now give
lodging to unknown persons who knock at the door; at
the most, and but rarely, do we permit a poor man passing
along in the country to sleep for a night in our hay-loft.
In the Middle Ages, men received their equals, not by
way of simple charity, but as a habit of courtesy and also
for pleasure. Known or unknown, the travelling knight
was rarely refused the door of a country manor. His
coming in time of peace was a happy diversion from the
monotony of the days. There was in every house the
<i>hall</i>, or large room where the meals were taken in common;
the new-comer ate with the lord at a table placed on a
raised platform called the <i>dais</i>, erected at one end of the
room; his followers were at the lower tables disposed
along the side walls. Supper finished, all soon retired
to rest, people went to bed and rose early in those days.
The traveller withdrew sometimes into a special room
for guests, if the house were large; sometimes into that
of the master himself, the <i>solar</i> (room on the first storey),
and spent the night there with him. Meanwhile, in the
hall, the lower tables were taken out, for in general these
were not standing, but movable;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn132" id="fnanc132">132</a>
mattresses were placed
on the ground over the litter of rushes which day and
night covered the pavement, and the people of the household,
the suite of the traveller, the
strangers of less <span class="xxpn" id="p123">{123}</span>
importance, stretched themselves out there till morning.
Such a litter of herbs or rushes was in constant use, and
was to be found in the king’s palace as well as in the houses
of mere merchants in the city: it was spread in lieu of
a carpet, to keep the room warm and to give a feeling
of comfort. It is still to be met with, and this is, apparently,
the last place where it has found refuge, in old-fashioned
French provincial <i>diligences</i>; the straw in
English country omnibuses is also its lineal descendant.
So it was at least when, in pre-automobile times, these
lines were originally written.</p>

<p>Prices paid for the purchase of rushes constantly recur
in the accounts of the royal expenses.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn133" id="fnanc133">133</a>
They were so
largely used in towns as well as in the country, that people
in cities did not know what to do with the soiled ones,
and the local authorities had to interfere over and over
again, especially in London, where the inhabitants were
apt to throw them into the Thames, with the result of
greatly damaging and polluting the water.</p>

<p>Through a window opened in the partition between his
room and the hall, over the dais, the lord could see and
even hear all that was done or said below. In the king’s
house itself the hall was used for sleeping as is shown by
the ordinances of Edward IV;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn134"
id="fnanc134">134</a> at a period much nearer our day
(1514), Barclay still complains that at Court the same
couch serves for two:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpp00">And never in the court shalt thou have bed alone,</div>
</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">and that the noise from the comers and goers, from
brawlers, <span class="xxpn" id="p124">{124}</span>
coughers, and chatterers never ceases, and prevents
sleep.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn135" id="fnanc135">135</a>
At the first streak of dawn, sending through the white or
coloured panes of the high windows shafts of light on the
dark carved timber-work, which, high above the pavement,
supported the roof, all stirred on their couches; soon they
were out of doors, horses were saddled, and the clatter of
hoofs sounded anew on the highway.</p>

<p>Towards the latter part of the fourteenth century a
change became noticeable in the use of the hall. It was
first pointed out by that acute observer of manners, William
Langland, the author of the “Visions.” Life was becoming,
by degrees, less patriarchal and more private;
people were less fond of dining almost publicly in their
halls. Well-to-do individuals began to prefer having their
meals by themselves in rooms with chimneys, which last
particular Langland is careful to note as a sign of the
growing luxuriousness of the times. “Elyng” (dull,
silent) “is the hall,” he said, in a well-known passage:</p>

<div class="dpoemfarlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span
 class="spquotebox">“</span>There the lorde ne the lady ·
 liketh noughte to sytte,</div>
<div class="dpp00">Now hathe uche riche a reule · to eten bi hym-selve</div>
<div class="dpp00">In a prive parloure · for pore mennes sake,</div>
<div class="dpp00">Or in a chambre with a chymneye · and
 leve the chief halle,</div>
<div class="dpp00">That was made for meles · men
 to eten inne.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn136"
 id="fnanc136">136</a></div>
</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">Less and less inhabited, the hall gradually became little
more than a sort of thoroughfare leading to the rooms
where people were living a life more private than before.
It decreased in size as well as in importance, until it was
nothing in ordinary houses but the vestibule which we
now see.</p>

<p>It must have been chiefly to the very poor, or the
very rich or powerful that the monastery served as a
hostelry. Monks received the former
out of charity, <span class="xxpn" id="p125">{125}</span>
and the latter out of necessity, the common inns being
at once too dear for the one and too miserable for the
other. They were intended for the middle class: merchants,
small landowners, itinerant packmen, etc. A
certain number of beds were placed in one room, and
a certain number of men in each bed, usually two, but
sometimes three, the latter number being in any case
frequent in Germany, according to Chaucer’s friend,
Eustache Des Champs, sent to those parts as “ambassador
and messenger” by the French king: “No one lies
apart, but two and two in a dark room, or oftener three
and three, in the same bed as it chances.” He regrets
the better manners and more refined customs of his own
country, “doux pays, terre très honorable.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn137" id="fnanc137">137</a></p>

<p>Travellers bought separately their food and drink,
chiefly bread, a little meat, and beer. Complaints as to
excessive prices were not less frequent than now. The
innkeeper’s extortions were supplemented by those of his
assistants. Chaucer’s good parson, branding those men
who encourage the evil practices of their subordinates,
does not forget “thilke that holden hostelries,” and who
“sustenen the theft of hir hostilers (ostlers).”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn138" id="fnanc138">138</a>
The
people petitioned parliament and the king interfered
accordingly with his wonted useless good will. Edward III
promulgated, in the 23rd year of his reign, a statute
to constrain “hostelers et herbergers” to sell food at
reasonable prices; and again, four years later, tried
to put an end to the “great and outrageous cost of
victuals kept up in all the realm by inn-keepers and other
retailers of <span class="xxpn" id="p126">{126}</span>
victuals, to the great detriment of the people travelling
through the realm.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn139"
id="fnanc139">139</a></p>

<p>To have an example of ordinary travelling, we may follow the
warden and two fellows of Merton College, who went with four servants
from Oxford to Durham and Newcastle in 1331.<a class="afnanc"
href="#fn140" id="fnanc140">140</a> They travelled on horseback;
it was in the dead of winter. Their food was very simple and their
lodging inexpensive, the same items constantly recur; they comprise,
on account of the season, candles and fire, sometimes a coal fire.
One of their days may give an idea of the rest: for a Sunday spent at
Alreton they write down:</p>

<p>Beds, we see, were not expensive; our men did not
spend more for them than for their beer. Another time,
the servants alone are at the inn, and the sleeping of the
four comes to a penny for two nights. Generally, when
the party is complete, the whole of their beds cost twopence;
at London the price was a little
higher, that is <span class="xxpn" id="p129">{129}</span>
a penny a head.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn141" id="fnanc141">141</a>
Sometimes they have eggs or vegetables
for a farthing, a chicken or a capon. When they had sauce
or condiments, they put them down separately, for example:
fat, ½d.; gravy, ½d.; pickle, the same price; sugar, 4d.;
pepper, saffron, mustard. Fish recurs regularly every
Friday. Evening comes, the roads are dark; the way
is lost, they take a guide, to whom they give a penny:
“In famulo ducenti nos de nocte, 1d.” On crossing the
Humber they pay eightpence, which may appear much,
compared with the other prices; but we must remember
that the river was wide and difficult to cross, especially
in winter. The annals of the Abbey of Meaux frequently
tell of the ravages caused by the river’s overflow, of farms
and mills destroyed, of entire domains submerged, and
of crops swept away. The ferry owners benefited by
these accidents, in continually augmenting their prices,
and at last the king himself was obliged to intervene in
order to re-establish the normal rate, which was a penny
for a horseman; this is what the
warden and fellows <span class="xxpn" id="p130">{130}</span>
with their company paid.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn142" id="fnanc142">142</a>
Some­times our travel­lers fur­nished
them­selves before­hand with pro­vi­sions to carry
with them; a salmon was bought, “for the journey,”
eight­een­pence, and for having it cooked, doubtless with
some complicated sauce, they pay eightpence.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Life-like specimens of dialogues on arrival, between
traveller and innkeeper, and discussion as to the price
of victuals, may be read in the Manual of French Conversation,
composed at the end of the fourteenth century
by an Englishman, under the title of “La Manière de
Language que t’enseignera bien à droit parler et escrire
doulz François.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn143" id="fnanc143">143</a></p>

<p>Chapter iii is particularly interesting. It shows “how
a man who is going far out of his own country, riding
or walking, should behave himself and talk upon the
way.” The servant sent forward to engage the room
utters the fond hope “&#x200a;‘that there are no fleas, nor
bugs, nor other vermin.’ ‘No, sir, please God,’ replies
the host, ‘for I make bold that you shall be well and comfortably
lodged here—save that there is a great peck of
rats and mice.’”</p>

<p>The provisions are passed in review, the fire lighted,
supper prepared: the traveller arrives, and it is curious
to note in what unceremonious fashion he assures himself
before dismounting that he will find at the inn “good
supper, good lodging, and the rest.”<a class="afnanc"

<p>Further on (chap. xiii) another hostelry is described,
and the conversation between two travellers who have
just slept in the same bed shows what a trouble the
fleas were: “William, undress and wash your legs,
and then dry them with a cloth, and rub them well for
love of the fleas, that they may not leap on
your legs, for <span class="xxpn" id="p133">{133}</span>

<div class="fsz6">(<i>From the MS. 10 E. IV.; English;

</div></div>

<p>Beer was drunk along the way, and was found in
other places besides the inn where travellers slept at night.
At the cross-roads, in the more frequented parts of the
country, alehouses, with a long projecting pole above the
door and a bush at the end of it, invited the traveller to
have a rest and a drink. Chaucer’s pilgrims, riding on
the way to Canterbury, dismounted at a house of this kind.
The pardoner, who had his habits, would not begin
his tale without a little comfort:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>But
first, quod he, her at this ale-stake</div>
<div class="dpp00">I wil bothe drynke and byten on a cake.”</div>
</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">A miniature of the fourteenth century, of which we give
a reproduction, represents the alehouse with its long
horizontal pole holding its bush well out in front above
the road. The house consists but of one storey, a woman
stands before the door with a large beer-jug, and a hermit
is drinking from a large cup. It was the fashion to have
extremely long poles, which offered no inconvenience in
the country, but in town they had to be regulated, and
a maximum length fixed. According to the wording of
the Act, poles so long were used, that they “did tend
to the great deterioration of the houses
in which they <span class="xxpn" id="p134">{134}</span>
were placed,” and they reached so far and had signs so
low, that they were in the way of the riders’ heads. The
Act of 1375 relating these grievances orders that in future
poles shall not extend more than seven feet over the public
way,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn145" id="fnanc145">145</a>
which was enough to give picturesqueness to streets
not so wide as ours.</p>

<p>There were taverns of ill-fame, especially in towns,
so bad some of them, that they might almost have gone
by another name. In one of the Latin dramas of Hrotsvitha,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn146" id="fnanc146">146</a>
tenth century, is shown the holy hermit Abraham,
who, learning that the girl Mary, whom he had reared in
virtue, lived as a courtesan in a hostelry, goes to her, pretending
love, and converts her. In most mediæval story
books telling of the prodigal son, he is usually represented
sowing his very wild oats at the inn or tavern.
Musicians of the meanest order would entertain the sitters
at the table with their pipings, and then pass the hat.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn147" id="fnanc147">147</a>
Having to answer before Archbishop Arundel for his disparaging
statements concerning pilgrimages, the Lollard
William Thorpe declares in 1407 that pilgrims are frequenters
of ill-famed hostelries, “spending their goods
upon vitious hostelars, which are oft uncleane women of
their bodies.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn148" id="fnanc148">148</a>
In some such inn, the “Cheker of the
Hope” (hoop) in Canterbury, the continuator of Chaucer
leads his pilgrims, and shows how the pardoner’s advances
to Kit the tapster had the edifying result of getting for him
many more blows than caresses.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn149" id="fnanc149">149</a></p>

<p>In London it was forbidden by the king
to keep open <span class="xxpn" id="p135">{135}</span>
house after curfew, and for very sufficient reasons, “because
such offenders as aforesaid, going about by night, do
commonly resort and have their meetings and hold their
evil talk in taverns more than elsewhere, and there do
seek for shelter, lying in wait and watching their time to
do mischief.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn150" id="fnanc150">150</a></p>

<p>It was for fear of such dangers that when the sheriffs
and bailiffs held their Views of Frankpledge, they asked
the juries of their hundreds to say upon oath what they
knew “of such as continually haunt taverns, and no man
knoweth whence they come; of such as sleep by day
and watch by night, eat well and drink well, and possess
nothing.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn151" id="fnanc151">151</a></p>

<p>Langland’s life-like picture of a tavern in the fourteenth
century is well known. With a vivid realism
worthy of Rabelais he makes us hear and see the tumultuous
scenes at the alehouse, the discussions, the quarrels,
the big bumpers, the drunkenness which ensues; every
face is plainly visible, coarse words, laughter and attitudes
strike the on-looker in that strange assembly, where the
hermit meets the cobbler and “the clerk of the churche,”
a band of cut-purses and bald-headed tooth-drawers:</p>

<div class="dpoemfarlft fsz6"><div class="dstanzalft">

class="afnanc" href="#fn153" id="fnanc153">153</a></div>
</div></div>

<p id="p136">Peasants, too, are found there. Christine de Pisan,
that poetess whose writings and character so often recall
steady John Gower, shows them drinking, fighting,
gambling; they have to appear before the provost, and
fines accrue to augment their losses:</p>

<p>“At these taverns each day will you find them established,
and enjoying long potations. As soon as their
work is over, many agree to go there and drink, and they
spend, you may be sure, more than they have earned all
day. Do not ask if they fight when they are tipsy, the
provost has several pounds in fines from it during the
year. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And there also are to be seen some of those
idle gallants who haunt taverns, handsome and gay.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn154" id="fnanc154">154</a></p>

<p>Art, literature, the trend of thought were changed at
the time of the Renaissance, but taverns remained the
same; witness Skelton’s description of an alehouse on
the highroad, quite similar to those which Langland had
known a century and a half earlier. The ale-wife, who
brews, God knows how, her beer herself, is a withered old
crony, not unlike the “weird sisters” who
were to welcome <span class="xxpn" id="p137">{137}</span>
Macbeth on the heath. She keeps her tavern near Leatherhead,
in Surrey, on a declivity by the highroad, and there
gathers as motley a crowd as that in the “Visions,”</p>

<p>Passers-by and dwellers in the neighbourhood flock
to her house:</p>

<div class="dpp00">And all for the good ale.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>The reputation of the houses with a long pole and
bush had not improved, and many of those who frequented
them had, as we see, little wish to be “espyde.”
As for paying the score, there was the rub! Devotees of
drink whose purse was empty would not deprive themselves,
however, and they paid in kind:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Instede

</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue" id="p138">As to the women, one brings:</p>

<div class="dpp00">Because the ale is good.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn155" id="fnanc155">155</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>The worst-famed of these houses began a little later
to receive the visits of the most illustrious of their customers,
one who held his court under their smoky rafters
and came there to his earthly end, “babbling of green
fields,” immortal Sir John Falstaff.</p>

<p>Other isolated houses along the roads, by the fords
or the bridges, on sacred spots, on the cliffs by the
sea, had also much to do with travellers, those of the
hermits. Such holy men would tell the way, help to cross
a river, sometimes give shelter, sometimes absolution.<a

pathless wood, Master Reynard reaches the secluded spot;

ST. ROBERT.<div class="fsz6">(<i>Hewn out of the rock,
Knaresborough; the knight of a much later date.</i>)</div>
</div></div>

<p>Most holy in early times, living examples of
renouncement, teaching virtue and piety by their words and
deeds, hermits became, some of them, canonized saints, like
St. Robert of Knaresborough,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn158"
id="fnanc158">158</a> or devotional writers of fame like
Richard Rolle, the hermit of Hampole; pilgrims flocked
to their cells in order to be sanctified by their advice
and presence. An “officium de Sancto Ricardo eremita” was
composed after Richard Rolle’s death, in the thought that
he would surely be canonized some day:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpp00">Letetur felix Anglorum patria&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</div>
<div class="dpp00">Pange lingua graciosi</div>
<div class="dpp00">Ricardi preconium,</div>
<div class="dpp00">Pii, puri, preciosi,</div>
<div class="dpp00">Fugientis vitium.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn159" id="fnanc159">159</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>These men fasted, had ecstasies, were tempted by the
devil, who in the case of Richard, instead of clumsily taking
some hideous shape (see further, p.
<a href="#p290" title="go to &#x70; 290">290</a>) took the much
more enticing one of “a faire yonge womane, the
whilke,” wrote the hermit, “I had sene be-fore and
the whilke luffed (loved) me noght a little in gude
lufe.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn160" id="fnanc160">160</a></p>

<p>The cave or hermitage in which
Saint Robert spent <span class="xxpn" id="p142">{142}</span>
most of his life still exists at Knaresborough, entirely
hollowed out of the rock, with a later-date perpendicular
window.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn161" id="fnanc161">161</a></p>

<p>Persuaded, rightly or wrongly, that they had much
to atone for, the kings included among the redeeming
good works to be performed by them aid to holy hermits.
One of the pilgrims who visited St. Robert was King
John, who came unheralded and who, according to the
metrical life of the saint, had some trouble in making
him notice his presence:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpp00">Roberd he fand knelan prayand,</div>
<div class="dpp00">Hys orysons contynuand,</div>

<div class="dpp00">Nay mare he mowed than dose ane ake (oak).<a class="afnanc" href="#fn162" id="fnanc162">162</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>Edward III gives to “three hermits and eight anchorite
recluse persons within the city of London and in the
suburbs thereof, to wit to each of them, 13s. 4d. in aid
of their support.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn163" id="fnanc163">163</a>
Welcomed on his landing, in 1399,
by a seaside hermit called Matthew Danthorp, “in quodam
loco called
Ravenserespourne” (Ravenspur), Bolingbroke, <span class="xxpn" id="p143">{143}</span>
soon to be King Henry IV, grants him and all the hermits
his successors a variety of favours, including the right
to any waif or wreck cast by the sea on the sand for two
leagues about his hermitage: “Cum wrecco maris, et
wayfs et omnibus aliis proficuis et commoditatibus super
sabulum per duas leucas circa eundem locum contingentibus
imperpetuum,” in spite of any statute to the
contrary.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn164" id="fnanc164">164</a></p>

<p>Less brilliant fortunes and less holy a fame usually
fell to the lot of English hermits of the fourteenth century.
Those like Rolle of Hampole, doing ceaseless penance,
consumed by divine love, were rare exceptions; they
lived by preference in cottages, built at the most frequented
parts of the highway, or at the entrance to bridges.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn165" id="fnanc165">165</a>
They
throve there, like Godfrey Pratt,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn166" id="fnanc166">166</a>
on the charity of the
passers-by; the bridge with its chapel was in itself almost
a sacred building; the presence of the hermit sanctified
it still further. He attended to the keeping in order of
the building, or was supposed to do so, and was willingly
given a farthing.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn167" id="fnanc167">167</a>
A strange race of men, which in that
century of disorganization and reform, when everything
seemed either to die or undergo a new birth, multiplied
in spite of rules and regulations. They swelled the number
of parasites of the religious edifice, cloaking under
a dignified habit a life that was less so.
These evil growths <span class="xxpn" id="p144">{144}</span>
clung, like moss in the damp of the cathedral, to the fissures
of the stones, and by the slow work of centuries threatened
the noble structure with ruin. What remedy was there?
To mow down the ever-growing weeds was scarcely
possible; a patient hand, guided by a vigilant eye, was
needed to pluck them out one by one, and to fill up the
interstices: saints can do this, but saints are rare. Episcopal
prescriptions might often seem to do great work; a mere
seeming. Though the heads were beaten down, the
roots remained, and the lively parasite struck yet deeper
into the heart of the wall.</p>

<div class="fsz6">(<i>From the MS. 10 E. IV; English;

</div></div>

<p>Solemn interdictions and rigorous rules were not
wanting, bowing down heads which ever rose again. To
become a hermit a man must be resolved on an exemplary
life of poverty and privations, and, that imposture should
be impossible, he must have episcopal sanction, that is,
possess “testimonial letters from
the ordinary.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn168" id="fnanc168">168</a>
These <span class="xxpn" id="p145">{145}</span>
rules were broken, however, without scruple. Inside his
dwelling the not very devout creature in hermit’s garb
could lead a quiet, easy life, and it was so hard elsewhere!
The charity of passers-by was enough for him to live
upon, especially if he was not harassed by an over-exacting
conscience and knew how to beg; no labour, no
pressing obligation, the bishop was distant and the alehouse
near. All these reasons caused a never-ending
growth of the mischievous species of false hermits who
only took the habit to live by it, without asking any permit
from any one. In the statutes they were bracketed with
beggars, wandering labourers, and vagabonds of all kinds,
pell mell, to be imprisoned awaiting judgment. There
was exception only for “approved” hermits: “Except
men of religion and approved hermits having letters testimonial
from the ordinary.” A statute like this is enough
to show that Langland did not exaggerate; his verse is
but a commentary on the law. The author of the
“Visions” is impartial and does justice to sincere anchorites:
true Christians resemble them.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn169" id="fnanc169">169</a>
But what are these
false saints who have pitched their tent by the side of
the highroads or even in the towns, at the door of the
alehouse, who beg under the church porches, who eat
and drink plentifully, and leisurely pass the evenings
warming themselves?</p>

<p>All these are unworthy of pity, and, adds Langland,
with that aristocratic touch which now and then recurs
in his lines, all these hermits were common artisans,
“workmen, webbes and taillours, and carters’ knaves”;
formerly they had “long labour and lyte wynnynge,”
but they noticed one day that these deceitful friars swarming
everywhere, “hadde fatte chekus” (cheeks); they
thereupon abandoned their labour and took lying garments,

<p>They are seldom seen at church, these false hermits,
but they are found seated at great men’s tables because
of their cloth. Look at them eating and drinking of
the best! they who formerly were of the lowest rank,
at the side tables, never tasting wine, never eating white
bread, without a blanket for their bed:</p>

<p id="p147">These rascals escape the bishops, who ought to have
their eyes wider open. “Alas!” said, in charming
language, a French poet of the thirteenth century, Rutebeuf,
“the coat does not make the hermit; if a man dwell in
a hermitage and be clothed in hermit’s dress, I don’t care
two straws for his habit nor his vesture if he does not
lead a life as pure as his frock betokens. But many folk
make a fine show and marvellous seeming of worth; they
resemble those over-blossoming trees that fail to bring
forth fruit.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn174" id="fnanc174">174</a></p>

<p>Under the eyes of the placid hermit, comfortably
established by the roadside, calmly preparing himself by
a carefree life for a blissful eternity, moved the variegated
flow of travellers, vagabonds, wayfarers, and wanderers.
His benediction rewarded the generous passer-by; the
stern look of the austere man did not disturb his sanctimonious
indifference. The life of others might rapidly
consume itself, burnt by the sun, gnawed by care; his
own endured in the shade of the trees, and continued
without hurt, lulled by the murmur of human passions—</p>

<h3 class="h3chap">CHAPTER III
<span class="hbig">SECURITY OF THE ROADS</span></h3>

<p class="pfirst">These roads,
thus followed in every direction by the king and the lords
moving from one manor to another, by the merchants and
peasants going to the fair, the market, or the staple,
by sheriffs, monks and itinerant justices, by ladies in
carriages and villains driving their carts, were they safe?
The theorist studying the legal ordinances of the period,
and the manner in which the county police and the town
watch and ward were organized, might come to the conclusion
that precautions were well taken for the prevention of
misdeeds, and that travelling did not present more danger
than it does at present. If we add, as Mr. Thorold Rogers
has shown, that common carriers plied their trade between
Oxford and London, Winchester, Newcastle, etc., and that
the price of transport was not dear, we might be persuaded
that the roads were quite safe, and we should be wrong;
wrong too, if on the faith of romantic tales, we pictured
to ourselves brigands in every thicket, a hanged man on
<span class="xxpn" id="p150">{150}</span> every branch,
and robber barons at every cross-road. But <i>accident</i>, or
the unexpected, must be taken into account.</p>

<p>Accident played a great part in the social life of the
fourteenth century. It was the moment when modern
life began, the outward brilliancy of a novel civilization
had recently modified society from top to bottom,
the need to be constantly on the watch had become less
apparent; the moated castle with its drawbridge, battlements
and loop-holes, had begun to change into a villa
or a mansion, while the hut was growing into a house.
Confidence was greater, but not always justified: accidents
are unexpected mishaps.</p>

<p>More means were taken than formerly to hinder
ill-doing; but numerous occurrences happened to destroy
this incipient security. Society was in reality neither
calm nor quite settled, and many of its members were
still half savage. The term “half” may be taken literally.
If a list were made of the characteristics of such or such
an individual of the time, it would be found that some
belonged to a refined, and some to a barbarous world.
Hence these contrasts: on one side order, which it would
perhaps be unjust not to consider as the normal condition;
and on the other, the frequent ebullitions of the untamed
nature. Let us select an example of such accidents which
could take at times remarkable proportions. Here are
a knight and his men at the corner of a road, waiting for
a troop of merchants. The text itself of the victims’
petition gives all the details of the encounter.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn175" id="fnanc175">175</a></p>

<p>The facts happened in 1342. Some Lichfield merchants
state to their lord, the Earl of Arundel, that on a
certain Friday they sent two servants and two horses
laden with “spicery and mercery,” worth forty pounds,
to Stafford for the next market day. When their men
“came beneath Cannock Wood” they met Sir Robert
de Rideware, Knight, waiting for
them, together with <span class="xxpn" id="p151">{151}</span>
two of his men, who seized on the servants, horses,
and goods, and took them to the priory of Lappeley.
Unfortunately for the knight, during the journey, one of
the servants escaped.</p>

<p>At the priory the band found “Sir John de Oddyngesles,
Esmon de Oddyngesles, and several others, knights
as well as others.” It was evidently a pre-arranged affair,
carefully devised; all was done according to rule; they
shared “among them the aforesaid mercery and spicery,
each one a portion according to his degree.” That done,
the company left Lappeley and rode to the priory of
Blythebury, a nuns’ priory. Sir Robert declared that
they were the king’s men, quite exhausted, and begged
for hospitality. But the company had obviously a suspicious
appearance, and the abbess refused. Indignant
at this unfriendly reception, the knights burst open the
doors of the barns and lofts, gave hay and oats to their
horses, and so passed the night.</p>

<p>But they were not the only people to have made a
good use of their time. The escaped servant had followed
them at a distance; when he saw they had taken
up their quarters at the priory he returned with all speed
to Lichfield and warned the bailiff who hastened to collect
his men for the pursuit of the robbers. The latter, men
of the sword, as soon as they were met, stood their ground,
and a real battle took place, in which they had at first the
upper hand, and wounded several of their pursuers. At
length, however, they were worsted and fled; all the spices
were recovered, and four of their company taken, who,
without further ado, were beheaded on the spot.</p>

<p>Robert de Rideware was not one of the latter, and
did not lose heart. He met his relative Walter de Rideware,
lord of Hamstall Rideware, with some of his followers,
while the bailiff was on his way back to Lichfield; all
together veered around in pursuit of the bailiff. A fresh
fight. This time the king’s officer was
routed and fled, <span class="xxpn" id="p152">{152}</span>
while the highway gentlemen once more captured the
spices.</p>

<p>What resource remained for the unhappy William
and Richard, authors of the petition? Resort to
justice? This they wanted to do. But as they were
going for this purpose to Stafford, chief town of the
county, they found at the gates some retainers of their
persecutors, who barred their passage and even attacked
them so hotly that they had difficulty in escaping without
grievous hurt. They returned to Lichfield, watched by
their enemies, and led there a pitiable existence. “And, sir,
the aforesaid William and Richard, and several people of
the town of Lichfield, are menaced by the said robbers and
their maintainers, so that they dare not go anywhere out
of the said town.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn176" id="fnanc176">176</a></p>

<p>This legal document, the original of which has been
preserved, is, in many ways, characteristic, and shows
us local tyrants not unlike the latter day ones in the
<i>Promessi Sposi</i> and their terrible <i>bravi</i>. One may,
especially, notice the coolness and determination of the
knights, not disconcerted by the death of four of their
number; the attack under cover of a wood; the selection
of the victims, “garsuns” belonging to rich merchants;
the request for hospitality in a priory under pretext of
journeying in the king’s service; the expeditious justice
of the bailiff, and the persistent surveillance to which the
victims were subjected by their lordly robbers.</p>

<p>These, though remarkable, are not quite exceptional
facts, and Robert of Rideware was not the only man on
the look out in the copses along the roads. Other noblemen
were, like him, supported by devoted retainers, ready
for any enterprise. Capes and liveries of their masters’
colours were given to them, and they went
about as the <span class="xxpn" id="p153">{153}</span>
uniformed soldiers of their chief; a lord well surrounded
with his partizans considered himself as above the common
law, and it was no easy matter for justice to make herself
respected by him. The custom of having a number of
resolute followers wearing one’s colours became universal
at the end of Edward III’s reign and under Richard II;
it survived in spite of statutes<a class="afnanc" href="#fn177" id="fnanc177">177</a>
during the whole of the
fifteenth century, and contributed to render even more
embittered and bloody the War of the Roses.</p>

<p>But even outside the periods of civil war, the misdeeds
of certain barons and their retainers, or of retainers acting
on their own account under cover of their lord’s colours—“notoirs
meffesours et meintenours of meffesours,” the
statute said of both,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn178" id="fnanc178">178</a>—were at times so frequent and serious
that parts of the country seemed to be in a state of war.
Throughout the fourteenth century, the abuse called
<i>maintenance</i>, which word meant in old French <i>protection</i>,
was on the increase, in spite of all the efforts of king and
Parliament. The great of the land, and some lesser people
too, had their own men, sworn to their service and ready
to do anything they were commanded, which consisted
sometimes in the most monstrous deeds, such as securing
property or other goods to which neither their masters,
nor any claimant paying their master in order to be thus
“protected,”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn179" id="fnanc179">179</a>
had any title. They
terrorized the rightful <span class="xxpn" id="p154">{154}</span>
owners, the judges and the juries, ransoming, beating
and maiming any opponent.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn180" id="fnanc180">180</a></p>

<p>Statutes were, as usual, numerous, well-meant, peremptory,
and inefficient. The evil was so general that
Edward III had to forbid the people nearest him, the
chief officers of his court, his “dearest consort, the queen,”
his son the prince of Wales, the prelates of Holy Church,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn181" id="fnanc181">181</a>
to thus interfere with the regular course of the law. The
will of the king is that “the poor should enjoy their right
just as the rich.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn182" id="fnanc182">182</a>
But they do not; great ladies practice
maintenance, one among others even dearer to the king
than his dear consort, namely his mistress, Alice Perers.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn183" id="fnanc183">183</a></p>

<p>A new reign begins; maintenance flourishes better
than ever before. The preamble of a statute of the second
year of Richard II<a class="afnanc" href="#fn184" id="fnanc184">184</a>
gives a perhaps somewhat exaggerated
picture of these disorders so as to better justify rigorous
measures, but the description must have been at least
partly true. We there see—and the king, it is stated,
has learnt it both from the petitions addressed to parliament
and by public rumour—that certain people in several
parts of the kingdom claimed “to have right to divers
lands, tenements and other possessions, and some espying
women and damsels unmarried, and some desiring to
make maintenance in their marches, do gather together
to a great number of men of arms and archers, <i>to the manner
of war</i>, and confederate themselves by oath and other
confederacy.” These people, having no “consideration
to God, nor to the laws of Holy Church,
nor of the land, <span class="xxpn" id="p155">{155}</span>
nor to right, nor justice, but refusing and setting apart
all process of the law, do ride in great routs in divers parts
of England, and take possession and set them in divers
manors, lands, and other possessions of their own authority,
and hold the same long with such force, <i>doing many manner
apparelments of war</i>; and in some places do ravish women
and damsels, and bring them into strange countries, where
please them; and in some places lying in await with such
routs do beat and maim, murder and slay the people, for
to have their wives and their goods, and the same women
and goods retain to their own use; and sometimes take
the king’s liege people in their houses, and bring and
hold them as prisoners, and at the last put them to fine
and ransom <i>as it were in a land of war</i>; and sometimes
come before the justices in their sessions in such guise
with great force, whereby the justices be afraid and not
hardy to do the law; and do many other riots and horrible
offences, whereby the realm in divers parts is put in great
trouble, to the great mischief and grievance of the people.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn185" id="fnanc185">185</a>
Which shows how vainly the Good Parliament had worked,
for, in 1376, the Commons had already made exactly
similar complaints: “Now great riot
begins anew by <span class="xxpn" id="p156">{156}</span>
many people in different parts of England who ride with
a great number of armed men,” etc.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn186" id="fnanc186">186</a></p>

<p>Besides these organized and quasi-seignorial bands,
there were ordinary robbers, numerous enough for chantries
to have been founded “for the safety of travellers who
were in danger from thieves.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn187" id="fnanc187">187</a>
Against those people
who impeded travelling much more grievously than
ever the floods and broken bridges, Edward I had taken,
in 1285, special measures in the Statute of Winchester.
These men were described there as accustomed to crouch
down in the ditches, coppice, or brushwoods near the
roads, especially those linking two market towns. This
was, of course, the passage-way of many easy victims,
richly laden. The king orders therefore that, for a space
of two hundred feet, the ground on each side of the road
should be cleared in such a manner that there remain
neither coppice nor brushwood, nor hollow nor ditch
which serve as shelter for malefactors: “où leur peut
tapir pur mal fere.” Only large trees such as oaks might
be left. The owner of the soil had to do the work; if he
neglected it, he would be responsible for robberies and
murders, and have to pay a fine to the king. If the road
went through a park, the same obligation lay on the lord,
unless he consented to close it by a wall or a hedge so
thick, or by a ditch so wide and deep, that robbers could
not cross them: “qe meffesurs ne pussent passer ne
returner pur mal fere.” The king sets the example and
orders such clearings to be made at once on the lands
belonging to the crown.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn188" id="fnanc188">188</a></p>

<p>After which, things continued pretty much as before:
“Mean­while,” writes a chronicler for
the years 1303–05, <span class="xxpn" id="p157">{157}</span>
“certain male­fac­tors, bound together, four, six, ten or
twenty went in company to fairs and markets, rifled the
houses of honest people and were not ashamed to capture
through their misdoings the goods of the faithful and
rich people.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn189" id="fnanc189">189</a>
Worse than that: we find as we progress
in the fourteenth century, that these common thieves had
improved their methods and increased their profits. They
allied themselves, sometimes secretly, sometimes openly,
to the seignorial bands, and were not henceforward unticketed
men for whom no one was responsible. The
Commons were aware of the fact, and complained accordingly:
“Whereas it is notoriously known <i>throughout all
the shires of England</i> that robbers, thieves, and other malefactors
on foot and on horseback, go and ride on the highway
through all the land in divers places, committing
larcenies and robberies: may it please our lord the king
to charge the nobility of the land that none such be
maintained by them, privately nor openly; but that they
help to arrest and take such bad ones.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn190" id="fnanc190">190</a>
In the preceding
parliament the same complaints had been made,
and the king had already promised that he would order
“such remedy as should be pleasing to God and man.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn191" id="fnanc191">191</a>
But neither God nor man had had apparently cause to
be pleased.</p>

<p>In addition to the support of the great, these evildoers
enjoyed various privileges. Some of them could be
met along the roads, cross in hand; both king and church
forbade seizing them, they were men who had forsworn
the realm. When a robber, a murderer, or any felon
found himself too hard pressed, he fled into a church
and found safety. In almost all societies having reached
a certain stage of civilization the same privilege has
existed or still exists. It was known
to the Romans, <span class="xxpn" id="p158">{158}</span>
was legislated about by Theodosius the Great, Justinian
and the early councils,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn192" id="fnanc192">192</a>
and is still in constant use in
many parts of the East. A church in the Middle Ages
was an inviolable place: whoever crossed its threshold
was under the protection of God, and many wonderful
miracles, the history of which was familiar to everybody,
attested with what particular favour the right of sanctuary
was regarded especially by the Holy Virgin. At Walsingham,
one of the most famous British pilgrimages, people
never failed to go and see the “Gate of the Knight,”
a gate which had stretched itself so as to give miraculous
shelter to a man on horseback, hard pursued by his enemies,
and who found himself thus opportunely placed beyond
the reach of men as well as beyond the reach of law.</p>

32. THE KNOCKER OF THE DURHAM SANCTUARY (NORMAN).
</div></div>

<p>Several interesting relics of old English sanctuaries
are still in existence, such as stone sign-posts
which helped the fugitive to avoid either vengeance
or justice: “Even to-day, in various parts of
England, curious stone crosses, <span class="xxpn"
id="p159">{159}</span> inscribed with the word <span
class="smcap">S<b>ANCTUARIUM</b></span>, are to be
met with. Such crosses probably marked the way to a
sanctuary and served to guide fugitives.”<a class="afnanc"
href="#fn193" id="fnanc193">193</a> At Durham is to be
seen a beautiful bronze knocker, cast and chiselled in
Norman times, still affixed to the cathedral door through
which malefactors were admitted to the sanctuary.<a
class="afnanc" href="#fn194" id="fnanc194">194</a> As
soon as they had knocked, the door was opened, the bell
in the Galilee tower was rung, and after having confessed
before witnesses their crime, which was at once put into
writing, the culprits were allowed to enjoy the peace of
St. Cuthbert. Several churches had a chair or stool called
the <i>fridstool</i>, or peace chair (originally, in some cases,
a presbyteral or episcopal seat) the reaching of which
by the fugitive secured for him the maximum protection.
Beverley has one of the oldest, in stone, perfectly
plain, formerly accompanied with a Latin inscription,
saying: “This stone seat is called <i>freedstoll</i>, that is,
chair of peace, on reaching which a fugitive criminal
enjoys complete safety.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn195"
id="fnanc195">195</a> The Beverley sanctuary was the
most celebrated and safest in England.<a class="afnanc"
href="#fn196" id="fnanc196">196</a> In this case, and
in some others, at Hexham for example, the privilege
extended not only to the church, but to one mile or more
round it, the space being divided into several circles,
usually marked by stone crosses, and it was more and more
sinful to remove fugitives violently from the sanctuary
the nearer <span class="xxpn" id="p160">{160}</span> they
were to the inner circle. If they were dragged from the
altar or the fridstool, no money atonement was accepted
from the abductor, who thus apparently forfeited his life.
Describing the several circles around the Hexham sanctuary,
Prior Richard, who wrote between 1154 and 1167, says of
the inner one: “If any one, moved by a spirit of madness,
ventured with diabolical boldness to seize one in the stone
chair near the altar which the English call <i>fridstol</i>,
that is a chair of quiet or peace, or at the shrine of the
holy relics, back of the altar, no compensation will be
determined for such a glaring sacrilege, no amount of money
will serve as an atonement, for it is what the English
call <i>botolos</i> (bootless), that is a thing for which there
can be no compensation.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn197"
id="fnanc197">197</a></p>

<div class="fsz6"><i>Fourteenth Century.</i></div>
</div></div>

<p>That same fridstool has been preserved, being not
improbably the original episcopal seat of the famous St.
Wilfrid, born about 634, the builder of
the old church <span class="xxpn" id="p163">{163}</span>
at Hexham, a crypt of which, with some Roman stones
used for the walls, is still in existence.</p>

<p>Near the fridstool was to be seen a queer, short, stone
statue now moved to another place in the church, of a
man, with brutal features, “wearing a long coat, buttoned
in front from the neck to the waist, having three coils or
clumsy ligatures .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. round his ankles; and he holds
erect with both hands a staff or club as tall as himself.”
A. B. Wright, author of an “Essay towards the history
of Hexham,” expresses the opinion that, “it was intended
to represent an officer of justice, with his staff and plume,
his feet bared and manacled, to show that within the
bounds of sanctuary he dared not move towards his
design and that there his authority availed him not.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn198" id="fnanc198">198</a></p>

<p>A confirmation of this opinion may be found in the
figures carved on the little known but very curious fridstool
at Sprotborough, Yorkshire, apparently of the fourteenth
century: the fugitive who could not be properly
represented seated in the chair, since this would have
made it impossible of use, is shown protected and covered
by it, while a clumsy and much deteriorated image of
some law official, carrying his staff, stands at one of the
sides of the chair, but unable to move, being bound to
it by a collar or <i>carcannum</i>.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn199" id="fnanc199">199</a></p>

<p>Among the most curious remembrances of the English
sanctuaries figure the registers still preserved in some few
places, in which were entered the confessions of the
criminals at the moment they asked for admittance.
The Beverley and the Durham ones have been printed;
both date from the fifteenth century; that of Durham
covers the years 1464 to 1524; it includes, besides other
crimes, 195 murders and homicides, in
which 283 persons <span class="xxpn" id="p164">{164}</span>
are concerned, and which are divided as follows, according

<p>The entries in the two registers are much alike; the
formalities are of the same kind; the Galilee bell is
tolled, the culprit confesses; witnesses are called to hear
him, and the names of all concerned are given in full.
Here is an example translated from the Latin original:
“To be remembered that on the 6th day of October,
1477, William Rome and William Nicholson, of the parish
of Forsate, fled to the cathedral church of St. Cuthbert
in Durham, where on account, among other things, of
a felony committed and publicly confessed by them, consisting
of the murder by them of William Aliand, they
asked from the venerable and religious men, Sir Thomas
Haughton, sacristan of the said church, and William
Cuthbert, master of the Galilee there, both brothers and
monks of the same church, to be admitted to the benefit
of the immunity of the church, according to the liberties
and privileges conceded in old time to the most glorious
confessor Cuthbert. And by the ringing of one bell
according to custom, they obtained this benefit. There
were present there, seeing and hearing, the discreet men
William Heyhyngton, Thomas
Hudson, John Wrangham, <span class="xxpn" id="p165">{165}</span>
and Thomas Strynger, witnesses called in especially for
the occasion.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn201" id="fnanc201">201</a></p>

<p>At Beverley there were no witnesses: the culprit
swore, his hand on the Book. Besides stating the cause
of his flying to sanctuary he took his oath to remain peaceful,
to help in case of fire or strife, to be present at mass
on the commemoration day of King Athelstan, benefactor
of the church, etc.:</p>

<div class="dblockquote">
<p>“Also ye shall bere no poynted wepen, dagger, knyfe,
ne none other wapen, ayenst the kynges pece.</p>

<p>“Also ye shalbe redy at all your power, if ther be
any debate or stryf, or oder sodan case of fyre within the
towne, to help to surcess it.</p>

<p>“Also ye shalbe redy at the obite of Kyng Adelstan,
at the dirige, and the messe, at such tyme as it is done, at
the warnyng of the belman of the towne, and doe your
dewte in ryngyng, and for to offer at the messe on the
morne,”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn202" id="fnanc202">202</a>
etc.</p></div>

<p>To drag men out of the sanctuary was a sacrilege
punished with whipping, heavy fines, excommunication,
or even death. Nicholas le Porter had helped to snatch
from the church of the Carmelites of Newcastle some
laymen who had taken refuge there “for the safety of
their lives,” and who, once delivered to the civil authority,
had been executed. Only the Pope’s nuncio could secure
for him his pardon, and he had to submit to a public
penance very little in accord with our present customs:</p>

<p>“We order,” wrote Bishop Richard to the parson of
St. Nicholas of Durham, “that on Monday, Tuesday,
and Wednesday of the Whitsun-week just coming, he
shall receive the whip from your hands publicly, before
the chief door of your church, in
his shirt, bare-headed, <span class="xxpn" id="p166">{166}</span>
and barefoot.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn203" id="fnanc203">203</a>
He shall there proclaim in English the
reason for his penance and shall admit his fault; and
when he has thus been whipped the said Nicholas will
go to the cathedral church of Durham, bareheaded, barefoot,
and dressed as above, he will walk in front, you will
follow him; and you will whip him in the same manner
before the door of the cathedral these three days, and he
will repeat there the confession of his sin.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn204" id="fnanc204">204</a></p>

<p>Excommunication was the punishment meted out
to Ralph de Ferrers, one of the retainers of the then all-powerful
John of Gaunt, for having dragged from the
Westminster sanctuary, at mass time, two prisoners escaped
from the Tower where his master had sent them, and
for having killed one in the process, 1378. The Duke
of Lancaster, in alliance then with Wyclif, caused the
reformer to write one of his most virulent treatises against
the right of sanctuary, asking for its abolition.</p>

<p>The right was, however, maintained; the king himself
did not dare to infringe upon it, and, though unwilling, had
to let traitors escape, by such means, his revenge or justice.
In a case of this kind, one of the Henries wrote to the
Prior of Durham, and careful as he was to state that he
bound himself only “for the present occasion,” there is
no doubt that his acknowledgment of the full immunities
enjoyed by St. Cuthbert’s church
had nothing <span class="xxpn" id="p167">{167}</span>
exceptional: “Trusty and welbeloved in God,” says the king,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn205" id="fnanc205">205</a>
“we grete you well. And wheras we undirstand that
Robert Marshall late comitted to prison for treason is
now escapid and broken from the same into youre church
of Duresme, we havyng tender zele and devocion to ye
honour of God and St. Cuthbert, and for the tendir favour
and affection that the right reverend father in God our
right trusty and welbeloved the Bisshop of Duresme our
chauncellor of England we have for his merits wol that
for that occasion nothyng be attempted that shud be
contrarie to the liberties and immunities of [your] church.
We therefor wol and charge you that he be surely kept
there as ye wol answere unto us for him.” As there
could be very little need for the king to declare such an
obvious feeling as his respect for St. Cuthbert, the earnest
recommendation by which he ends his epistle is most
likely to have been the real cause of his writing to his
wellbeloved the Prior of Durham. Another characteristic
instance is the rebellion of Jack Cade in 1450, when
one of his accomplices fled to St. Martin-le-Grand, the
most famous of the London sanctuaries. The king in
this case wrote to the Dean of St. Martin’s ordering him
to produce the traitor. This the Dean refused to do, and he
exhibited his charters, which being found correct and explicit,
the fugitive was allowed to remain in safety where he was.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn206" id="fnanc206">206</a></p>

<p>The right of sanctuary was most valuable, not only
for political offenders, but also, and more frequently, for
robbers. They escaped from prison, fled to the church,
and saved their lives. “In this year,” 1324, say the
“Croniques de London,”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn207" id="fnanc207">207</a>
“ten persons escaped out
of Newgate, of whom five were retaken,
and four escaped <span class="xxpn" id="p168">{168}</span>
to the church of St. Sepulchre, and one to the church of
St. Bride, and afterwards all for-swore England.” But
when the refugees were watched in the church by their
personal enemies, their situation, as evidenced by the
statute of 1315–1316, became perilous. The authors of
a petition<a class="afnanc" href="#fn208" id="fnanc208">208</a>
to the king set forth in that year that armed
men established themselves in the cemetery, and even
in the sanctuary, to watch the fugitive, and guarded him
so strictly that he could not even go out to satisfy his
natural wants. They hindered food from reaching him;
if the felon decided to swear that he would quit the kingdom
his enemies followed him on the road, and in spite
of the law’s protection dragged him away and beheaded
him without judgment. The king reforms all these
abuses,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn209" id="fnanc209">209</a>
and re-enacts the old regulations as to abjuration,
which were as follows: “When a robber, murderer, or
other evil-doer shall fly unto any church upon his confession
of felony, the coroner shall cause the abjuration
to be made thus: Let the felon be brought to the church
door, and there be assigned unto him a port, near or far
off, and a time appointed for him to go out of the realm,
so that in going towards that port he carry a cross in his
hand, and that he go not out of the king’s highway, neither
on the right hand, nor on the left, but that he keep it
always until he shall be gone out of the land; and that
he shall not return without special grace of our lord the
king.”</p>

<p>The felon took oath in the following terms: “This
hear thou, sir coroner, that I, N., am a robber of sheep,
or of any other beast, or a murderer of one or of more,
and a felon to our lord the King of England, and because
I have done many such evils or robberies in
this land, I <span class="xxpn" id="p169">{169}</span>
do abjure the land of our lord Edward King of England,
and I shall haste me towards the port of such a place which
thou hast given me, and I shall not go out of the highway,
and if I do I will that I be taken as a robber and felon
to our lord the king; and at such a place I will diligently
seek for passage, and that I will tarry there but one flood
and ebb, if I can have passage; and unless I can have
it in such a place I will go every day into the sea up to my
knees assaying to pass over; and unless I can do this
within forty days, I will put myself again into the church
as a robber and a felon to our lord the king. So God me
help and his holy judgment.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn210" id="fnanc210">210</a></p>

<p>Dover was the port oftenest assigned to abjurors.
The time limit varied, being on occasions so brief, that
it must have been almost impossible for people on foot
to fulfil the condition: which was most probably what
the coroner had in view, for he would assign sometimes
different delays to different refugees for the same distance.
“The distance from York to Dover over London
Bridge was nearly 270 miles, and there are several entries
of eight days being the allotted time, thus maintaining
a rate of over 33 miles a day.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn211" id="fnanc211">211</a>
<span class="xxpn" id="p170">{170}</span></p>

<p>In the church robbers found themselves side by side
with insolvent debtors. These before seeking refuge
were usually careful to make a general donation of all
their property, and the creditors who cited them to justice
remained empty handed. In 1379,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn212" id="fnanc212">212</a>
Richard II enacted
remedial legislation. During five weeks, once a week, the
debtor is to be summoned, by proclamation made at the
door of the sanctuary, to appear in person or by attorney
before the king’s judges. If he does not choose to appear
justice shall take its course; sentence will be passed, and
the property that he had given away will be shared
among the creditors.</p>

<p>This, however, served, as usual, only for a time. In the
first years of the following reign the Commons are found
lamenting the same abuses. Apprentices who have plundered
their masters, tradesmen in debt, robbers, flee to
St. Martin-le-Grand and live there in quiet on the money
they have stolen. They employ the leisure which this
peaceful existence leaves them in patiently forging “obligations,
indentures, acquitances,” imitating the signatures
and seals of honest city merchants and of other people.
Felons, murderers and thieves avail themselves of this
restful seclusion for preparing new crimes; they go out
at night to commit them, and safely return in the morning
to their inviolate retreat. The king, apparently puzzled
as to what to do, when the abuse is so
great and the privilege <span class="xxpn" id="p171">{171}</span>
so sacred, vaguely promises that “reasonable remedy shall
be had.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn213" id="fnanc213">213</a></p>

<p>Some years later (<span class="smmaj">A.D.</span> 1447) the Goldsmiths’ Company
of London was startled on finding that a quantity
of sham gold and silver plate and jewellery had been issued
from the privileged precincts of St. Martin-le-Grand’s
sanctuary, to the great detriment of their own worshipful
company. They brought the facts to the notice of the
king, who wrote to the Dean recommending him to check
this abuse if possible: “Trustie and welbeloved, we
grete you wel, and let you to wote that we be informed
that there be divers persons dwellinge within our seinctuarie
of St. Martin’s that forge and sell laton and coper,
some gilt and some sylverd for gold and silver, unto the
great deceipt of our lege people.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn214" id="fnanc214">214</a>
The tone of
the king’s letter is very moderate; he seems to write
only to please the Goldsmiths’ Company, while realizing
that he is powerless in the matter, and that his recommendations
will come to nothing.</p>

<p>A priest who took refuge in a church was not obliged
to quit England; he swore that he was a priest, and
“enjoyed ecclesiastic privilege, according to the praiseworthy
custom of the kingdom.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn215" id="fnanc215">215</a>
But the church, who
accorded to all comers the benefit of sanctuary, reserved
to herself the power of removal from it. “In this year
(1320), a woman who was named Isabel of Bury, killed
the priest of the church of All Saints, near London Wall,
and she remained in the same church five days, so that
the Bishop of London issued his letter that the church
would not save her, wherefore she was brought out of
the church to Newgate and was hanged on the third day
afterwards.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn216" id="fnanc216">216</a>
<span class="xxpn" id="p172">{172}</span></p>

<p>In those days, when riots and rebellions were not
uncommon, the right of sanctuary might be valuable for
any one; reformers like Wyclif vainly protested against
this exorbitant but useful custom.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn217" id="fnanc217">217</a>
A bishop even, however
sacred his person, might have to spur his horse and
fly towards a church to save his head. The Bishop of
Exeter tried and failed when Isabella and her son came
to overthrow Edward II:<a class="afnanc" href="#fn218" id="fnanc218">218</a>
“The same day came one
Sir Walter de Stapleton, who was Bishop of Exeter, and
the king’s treasurer the previous year, riding to his house
in Elde Deanes lane to his dinner, and there he was proclaimed
traitor; and he seeing that fled on his horse
towards the church of St. Paul’s, and was there met and
quickly unhorsed, and brought to Cheap, and there he
was stripped and his head cut off.”</p>

<p>Under Richard III might be seen a queen and a king’s
son refuse to quit the sacred enclosure of Westminster,
in which their lives were safe, thanks to the sanctity of
the place. Sir Thomas More has left in his history of
the usurper, the first real history in the national language,
a moving picture of the plucky defence of Edward IV’s
widow and of the persistent efforts of Richard to snatch
the second child of the late king from the abbey. To
reiterated demands the queen replied: “In what place
coulde I recken him sure, if he be not sure in this the
sentuarye whereof was there never tiraunt yet so develish,
that durst presume to breake. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. For soth he hath
founden a goodly glose, by whiche that place that may
defend a thefe, may not save an innocent.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn219" id="fnanc219">219</a>
The “goodly
glose” of Richard III consisted simply in having the
right of sanctuary abolished. In a speech
in favour of <span class="xxpn" id="p173">{173}</span>
the measure, which was aimed especially at the places
of refuge of St. Paul’s and Westminster, the Duke of
Buckingham is represented by More drawing a very
lively as well as an exact picture of the disorders there:
“What a rabble of theves, murtherers, and malicious
heyghnous traitours, and that in twoo places specyallye. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Mens wyves runne thither with theyr housebandes
plate, and saye, thei dare not abyde with theyr housebandes
for beatinge. Theves bryng thyther theyr stolen goodes,
and there lyve thereon. There devise thei newe roberies;
nightlye they steale out, they robbe and reve, and kyll,
and come in again as though those places gave them not
only a safe garde for the harme they have done, but a
license also to doo more.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn220" id="fnanc220">220</a></p>

<p>This privilege endured, however, and even survived
the Reformation; but from that hour it was less respected.
Lord Chancellor Bacon speaks of the sanctuary of Colnham,
near Abingdon, as being considered “insufficient”
for traitors, under Henry VII; several political criminals
who had taken refuge there, were seized, therefore, and
one of them was executed.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn221" id="fnanc221">221</a>
Sanctuaries were suppressed,
legally at least, in the twenty-first year of the reign of
James I: “And be it alsoe enacted by the authoritie of
this present parliament that no
sanctuarie or priviledge <span class="xxpn" id="p174">{174}</span>
of sanctuary shal be hereafter admitted or allowed in any
case.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn222" id="fnanc222">222</a>
But they lingered on in England as well as
on the continent. Cromwell complains, in one of his
most famous speeches, of the difficulties his Government
sometimes experience on that account when they have
to ask from foreign potentates that justice be done. He
alludes to the recent assassination of an English messenger,
and says: “It is the pleasure of the Pope at any time
to tell you that though the man is murdered, yet his
murderer has got into the sanctuary.” Another proof
that, after the statute of James I, the right of sanctuary
did not fall entirely into disuse in England is that it had
to be re-abolished in 1697; sanctuaries are to be found
even so late as the reign of George I, when the one at
St. Peter’s, Westminster, was demolished.</p>

<p>With all their penal severity, law and custom still
gave other encouragements to malefactors. They often
received charters of pardon which the royal chancery
willingly granted because they must be paid for, while
the Commons unweariedly renewed their complaints
against this abuse. The priest, John Crochille, states
to the king in parliament that while he was at the Court
of Rome he has been outlawed, and was imprisoned on
his return. The chancellor has granted him a charter
of pardon, but he is “so impoverished that he has not
wherewith to pay for the said charter.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn223" id="fnanc223">223</a></p>

<p>Charters were thus given to the innocent for money,
and to “common felons and murderers” also, which
had two results: the number of brigands increased
by reason of their impunity, and men dared not bring
the most formidable criminals to justice for fear of seeing
them return pardoned and ready to wreak a terrible revenge.</p>

<p>Most unluckily, the interest that the
great had in <span class="xxpn" id="p175">{175}</span>
the continuance of this abuse tended also to its maintenance.
In league with their retainers, they wanted to defend
them from justice as they themselves were defended by
them in the street or on the road; and the best means
of saving these <i>bravi</i> from the consequences of some
assassination was to obtain or buy for them a charter of
pardon. The Commons knew it, and reminded the king
that often the protectors of such criminals secured charters
for them on the representation that these men were
abroad, occupied in fighting for the prince. The charter
once obtained, the malefactors returned and renewed their
ill-deeds, without fear of being troubled by any one.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn224" id="fnanc224">224</a></p>

<p>For all these reasons the traveller would not have
been prudent if he had not foreseen on starting the chance
of some untoward meeting, and if he had not armed himself
in consequence. This was such a recognized necessity that
the Chancellor of the University of Oxford allowed the
students, on the occasion of a journey, to carry arms,
otherwise strictly forbidden.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn225" id="fnanc225">225</a></p>

<p>There was, then, at best, but moderate safety against
robbers, and there was not always much against the sheriff’s
officers themselves. At a time when prowlers were so
numerous, it was enough to be a stranger in the district,
especially if it were night, to be sent to
gaol on suspicion, <span class="xxpn" id="p176">{176}</span>
as shown by a statute of Edward III.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn226" id="fnanc226">226</a>
Nothing more
general than the terms of this law; the power to arrest
is almost unlimited: “Whereas, in the statute made at
Winchester in the time of King Edward, grandfather to
the king that now is, it is contained, That if any stranger
pass by the country in the night, of whom any have suspicion,
he shall presently be arrested and delivered to the
sheriff, and remain in ward till he be duly delivered; and
because there have been divers manslaughters, felonies,
and robberies<a class="afnanc" href="#fn227" id="fnanc227">227</a>
done in times past, by people that be called
roberdesmen, wastors, and draw-latches .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ” whoever
suspects any to be one such, “be it by day or by night,”
shall cause him immediately to be arrested by the constables
of the towns; the man shall be kept in prison
till the justices of gaol delivery come down, and meanwhile
inquiry shall be made.</p>

<p>Think now of a stranger passing through the town
by night; some constable feels suspicious and wants to
arrest him; imagining himself already in prison “till
the justices come down,” the man runs away instead of
allowing himself to be taken. The statute has provided
for his case.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn228" id="fnanc228">228</a>
“If they will not obey the arrest, hue
and cry shall be levied upon them, and such as keep the
watch shall follow with hue and cry with all the town,
and the towns near, and so hue and cry shall be made
from town to town until that they be
taken and delivered <span class="xxpn" id="p177">{177}</span>
to the sheriff.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn229" id="fnanc229">229</a>
A singular picture: night wraps in
its shadows the crooked lanes of the unlit city; the
stranger is perhaps a robber, perhaps an honest man,
who has lost his way, not knowing the place; his fault
is not to be within doors by curfew; he gropes his way
as best he can; the watch perceives and challenges
him; fearing the result he takes to his heels, and behold!
the hue and cry begins, the watch runs, the town wakes
up, lights appear, and one after the other the more zealous
join in the chase. If the town is fortified, the postern
gates have long been closed, and he will be surely taken.
Scarcely can he hope to cast himself into some unshut
doorway at a turning of the street, behind which he will
cower, listening with trembling hand and beating heart
to the watch who pass heavily along at a charging pace,
followed by a crowd of furious shouters. The number
of steps lessen, and the shouts become fainter, then die
away, lost in the depths of the city.</p>

<p>If the place is not important enough to be enclosed by
walls, the first thought of the fugitive will be to gain
the open, and then he must not fear marshes, ditches,
hedges; he must know how, at a bend of the ground, to leave
the high-road and profit by any place where the Statute
of Winchester has been negligently applied. But for that
he is lost, the constables follow, the town follows, the
“cry” continues, and at the next village the scene of
the start will begin over again. The inhabitants, warned
by the clamour, light their lanterns, and see, they are
already in the chase. Before he reaches the end of the
high-street some peasant will be found on the alert,
ready to bar the passage of the road to him. All have an
interest in it, all have been robbed, or their friends,
or relatives; <span class="xxpn" id="p178">{178}</span>
someone of their kin may have been wounded or murdered on
the road as he returned from market. Every one has heard
of such misfortunes, and feels himself personally menaced.
Hence this zeal in joining the chase with the hue and
cry, and the conviction that, running so hard and making
so many folk run, the fugitive must be a famous brigand
ready for the gibbet.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn230"

what sort of a life the way­farer led, and what was his
importance in society or in the State.</p>

<p>Wayfarers belonging to civil life were, in the first place,
quacks and drug-sellers, glee-men, tumblers, minstrels, and
singers; then messengers, pedlars, and itinerant chapmen;
lastly, outlaws, thieves of all kinds, peasants out
of bond or perambulating workmen, and beggars. To
ecclesiastic life belonged preachers, mendicant friars, and
those strange dealers in indulgences called pardoners.
Lastly there were palmers and
pilgrims, whose journeyings <span class="xxpn" id="p182">{182}</span>
had a religious object, but in whose ranks, as in Chaucer’s
book, clerk and lay were mingled.</p>

<p>Many of these individuals, the friars for instance,
had, it is true, a resting-place, but their existence was
spent, for the greater part, on the roads; when they left
their abode their purpose was not to reach this or that
place, they had no fixed itinerary, but spent their time
in ceaseless rambles about the country, begging as they
went. They had, in the long run, caught the manners
and the language of true nomadic wayfarers, and in
common opinion were generally confounded with them;
they belonged to that caste or family of beings.</p>

<p>As for the strange race which we still see at the present
day wandering from country to country, and which, later
than any, will represent among us the caste of wanderers,
it had not yet made its appearance in the British world,
and are outside the limits of the present work. The
Bohemians or Gipsies remained entirely unknown in
England till the fifteenth century.</p>

<h3 class="h3chap">CHAPTER I
<span class="hbig">HERBALISTS, CHARLATANS, MINSTRELS,
JUGGLERS, AND TUMBLERS</span></h3>

<p class="pfirst">The most popular of all the wanderers were naturally
the most cheerful, or those held to be the most
beneficent. These latter were the folks with a
universal panacea, very numerous in the Middle Ages;
they went about the world selling health. They established
themselves in the village green, or the market place,
on holidays, spreading a carpet or a piece of cloth on the
ground; they displayed their drugs, and began to harangue
the people. Their numbers go diminishing nowadays,
for the laws are more and more unkind to them, but they
have not yet entirely disappeared, so
natural to man <span class="xxpn" id="p184">{184}</span>
are credulity and the longing for health. One may still
hear at the present day discourses not very different from
those they spoke in the fourteenth century in England,
France, or Italy; their profession is one that has changed
less than any. In the thirteenth century the herbalist of
Rutebeuf spoke like Ben Jonson’s mountebank of the
seventeenth, like the charlatan who yesterday a few
steps from our door attracted the crowd to his trestle,
limiting however his sales, on account of the churlishness
of the legislator, to tonics, tooth pastes and the
like. Big words, marvellous tales, praise of their noble
and distant origin, enumeration of the extraordinary cures
they have made, ostentatious display of an unbounded
devotion to the public good, and of entire pecuniary disinterestedness:
all this is found, and always will be found,
in the talk of these insinuating itinerants, as it is also found
to-day in the advertisements, on walls or in newspapers,
of wondrous cures discovered by a priest, by a convent, by
a gentleman of worth and disinterestedness; which advertisements
have, to some extent, replaced the itinerant healer
of olden times.</p>

<p>“Good people,” said Rutebeuf’s medicinal herb-seller
six hundred years ago, “I am not one of those poor
preachers, nor one of those poor herbalists who stand
in front of churches with their miserable ill-sown cloak,
who carry boxes and sachets and spread out a carpet.
Know that I am not one of these; but I belong to a lady
whose name is Madame Trote de Salerno, who makes a
kerchief of her ears, and whose eyebrows hang down as
silver chains behind her shoulders: know that she is the
wisest lady that is in all the four parts of the world. My
lady sends us into different lands and countries, into
Apulia, Calabria, Burgundy, into the forest of Ardennes
to kill wild beasts in order to extract good ointments from
them, and give medicine to those who are ill in body. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
And because she made me swear by the
saints when I <span class="xxpn" id="p185">{185}</span>
parted from her, I will teach you the proper cure for worms,
if you will listen. Will you listen?</p>

<p>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Take off your caps, give ear, look at my herbs
which my lady sends into this land and country; and
because she wishes the poor as well as the rich to have
access thereto, she told me that I should make pennyworths
of them, for a man may have a penny in his purse
who has not five pounds; and she told and commanded
that I might take pence of the current coin in the land
and country wherever I should come.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>“These herbs, you will not eat them; for there is
no ox in this country, no charger, be he never so strong,
who if he had a bit the size of a pea upon his tongue would
not die a hard death, they are so strong and bitter. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
You will put them three days to sleep in good white wine;
if you have no white take red, if you have no red take fine
clear water, for one may have a well before his door who
has not a cask of wine in his cellar. If you breakfast
from it for thirteen mornings you will be cured of your
various maladies. For if my father and mother were in
danger of death and they were to ask of me the best herb
I could give them, I should give them this. This is how
I sell my herbs and my ointments; if you want any, come
and take them; if you don’t, let them alone.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn231" id="fnanc231">231</a></p>

<p>This herbalist was of those early maligned in France
and England by royal ordinances for the illegal practice
of medicine. Philip the Fair in 1311, John the Good
in 1352, had issued severe decrees against them. They
were berated with being “ignorant of men’s temperament,
of the time and mode of administering, of the virtues of
medicines, above all, of laxative ones in which lies danger
of death.” These people “often come from abroad,” go
through town and suburbs, and venture to administer to
the confiding sick, “clisteria multum
laxativa et alia <span class="xxpn" id="p186">{186}</span>
eis illicita,”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn232" id="fnanc232">232</a>
at which the royal authority was justly
indignant.</p>

<p>In England the itinerant drug-sellers had no better
reputation; the popular songs, satires and farces always
show them associating in taverns with the meanest rabble,
and using—true to nature—the most ridiculous rant.
Master Brundyche’s man, in a play of the fifteenth century,
thus prepares the minds of the hearers for the advent of
the “leech,” his master, deriding both:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpp00">What dysease or syknesse y<sup>t</sup> ever ye have,</div>
<div class="dpp00">He wyl never leve yow tylle ye be in your grave.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn233" id="fnanc233">233</a></div>
</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">To have an idea of what their recipes
might be, one must recall what the medicine was that the
statutes of the kingdom protected. John of Gaddesden,
court doctor under Edward II, got rid of the marks of the
small-pox by wrapping the sick man in red cloths, and he
thus cured the heir to the throne himself.<a class="afnanc"
href="#fn234" id="fnanc234">234</a> He had for a long time
been troubled how to cure stone: “At last,” says he, in his
“Rosa Anglica,” “I bethought myself of collecting <span
class="xxpn" id="p187">{187}</span> a good number of those
beetles which in summer are found in the dung of oxen, also
of the crickets which sing in the fields. I cut off the
heads and the wings of the crickets and put them with the
beetles and common oil into a pot; I covered it and left
it afterwards for a day and night in a bread oven. I drew
out the pot and heated it at a moderate fire, I pounded the
whole and rubbed the sick parts; in three days the pain had
disappeared”; under the influence of the beetles and the
crickets the stone had broken into bits.<a class="afnanc"
href="#fn235" id="fnanc235">235</a> It was almost always
thus, by a sudden illumination, bethinking himself of
beetles or of something else, that the learned man
discovered his most efficacious remedies: Madame Trote de
Salerno never confided to her agents in the various parts
of the world the secret of more marvellous and unexpected
recipes.</p>

<p>The law, however, made a clear distinction between
a court physician and a quack of the cross-ways. Kings
and princes had their own healers, attached to their persons,
whom they trusted more than they did their ministers.
Securing by indentures of 1372 and 1373 the services
of “frere William de Appleton, phisicien et surgien,”
and of “Maistre Johan Bray,” granting them forty marks
yearly pension with the “bouche en court,” or right to be
fed at his tables, and other advantages, John of Gaunt,
“roy de Castille,” was careful to bind those men of
learning to attend on him “in peace and in war, <i>so long
as they lived</i>,” a pledge which his brother, King Edward,
never exacted from his chancellors. A Gaddesden had
the support of an established reputation to apply any
medicament to his patients, and he offered the warranty
of his high position. He had studied at Oxford, and he
was an authority; a grave physician like Chaucer’s
“doctour,” who had grown rich during the plague, his
wealth increasing his repute— <span class="xxpn" id="p188">{188}</span></p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpp00">“For gold in physik is a cordial,”</div>
</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">had not neglected to pore over the
works of “Gatesden.”</p>

<p>With lesser book-knowledge but an equal ingenuity,
the wandering herbalist was not so advantageously known:
<i>he</i> could not, like the royal physician, rely on his good
reputation and his “bouche en court” to make his patients
swallow glow-worms, rub them with beetles and crickets,
or give them “seven heads of fat bats”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn236" id="fnanc236">236</a>
as remedies.
The legislator kept his eye on him. In the country, like
most of the other wayfarers, the man nearly always found
means to escape the rigour of the laws; but in towns the
risk was greater. The unhappy Roger Clerk was sued in
1381 for the illegal practice of medicine in London, because
he tried to cure a woman by making her wear a certain
parchment on her bosom. Though such a nostrum could
not possibly be more hurtful than the use of fat bats, he
was carried to the pillory “through the middle of the city,
with trumpets and pipes,” on a horse without a saddle,
his parchment and a whetstone round his neck, unseemly
pottery hanging round his neck and down his back, in
token that he had lied.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn237" id="fnanc237">237</a></p>

<p>Uneasy at the increase of these abuses, Henry V issued
in 1421 an <i>Ordinance against the meddlers with physic and
surgery</i>, “to get rid of the mischiefs and dangers which
have long continued within the kingdom among the people
by means of those who have used the art and practice of
physic and surgery, pretending to be well and sufficiently
taught in the same arts, when of truth they are not so.”
Henceforth there would be severe punishments for all
practitioners who have not been approved in their speciality,
“that is to say, those of physic by the universities, and
the surgeons by the masters of that
art.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn238" id="fnanc238">238</a>
The mischief <span class="xxpn" id="p189">{189}</span>
continued just as before; which seeing, in order to give
more authority to the medicine approved by the State,
Edward IV, in the first year of his reign, erected the Company
of Barbers of London using the faculty of surgery,
into a corporation.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn239" id="fnanc239">239</a></p>

<p>The Renaissance came and found barbers, quacks,
empirics, and sorcerers continuing to prosper on British
soil, and still the subject of song, satire and play. John
Heywood’s Pothecary is a lineal descendant of Rutebeuf’s
herbalist; he sells a wonderful <i>Syrapus de Byzansis</i>, and
advertises it in such a way that, anything that happens,
he is right:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>These
be the thynges that breke all stryfe</div>
<div class="dpp00">Betweene mannes sycknes and his lyfe;</div>
<div class="dpp00">From all payne these shall you delever</div>
<div class="dpp00">And set you even at reste for ever.”<a
class="afnanc" href="#fn240" id="fnanc240">240</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>Henry VIII deplored the hold those men kept on
the com­mon people, and on some of their bet­ters
too; he con­sid­ered it his duty to enact new rules.
“The science and connyng of physyke and surgerie,”
said the king in his statute, “to the per­fecte know­lege
wherof bee re­qui­site bothe grete lernyng and ripe
ex­per­i­ence, ys daily within this Royalme exer­cised by a
grete mul­ti­tude of ignoraunt persones, of whom the grete
partie have no maner of insight in the same nor in any
other kynde of lernyng; some also can no lettres on the
boke, soofarfurth that common artificers, as smythes,
wevers, and women boldely and custumably take upon
theim grete curis and thyngys of great difficultie, in the
which they partely use sorcery and which-crafte, partely
applie such medicine unto the disease as be verey noyous
and nothyng metely therfore, to
the high displeasoure <span class="xxpn" id="p190">{190}</span>
of God .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and destruccion of many of the kynge’s liege
people, most specially of them that cannot descerne the
uncunnyng from the cunnyng.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn241" id="fnanc241">241</a>
The examples above
have shown how difficult it must often have been to
“descerne” between them.</p>

<p>Consequently, the king continues, every one who
may wish to practise in London or seven miles round,
must previously submit to an examination before the
bishop of that city, or before the Dean of St. Paul’s,
assisted by four “doctors of phisyk.” In the country
the examination will take place before the bishop of
the diocese or his vicar-general. In 1540, the same
prince united the corporation of the barbers and the
college of surgeons, and granted each year to the new
association the bodies of four condemned criminals “for
anathomies.”</p>

<p>Hardly were all these privileges conceded than doubts
filled the mind of the legislator himself, and who, it may
be wondered, did he regret? precisely those old unregistered
quacks, those possessors of infallible secrets, those
village empirics so harshly treated in the statute of 1511.
A new law was enacted, which is but one long enumeration
of the guilty practices of qualified doctors; they poison
their clients as thoroughly as the quacks of old, the
chief difference is that they take more for it, refusing
even to interfere if the patient is poor:</p>

<p>“Mynding oonelie theyre owne lucres, and nothing
the profite or ease of the diseased or patient, [they] have
sued, troubled and vexed divers honest persones aswell
men as woomen, whome God hathe endued with the
knowledge of the nature, kinde, and operacion of certeyne
herbes, rotes, and waters, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and yet the saide persones
have not takin any thing for theyre peynes and cooning,
but have mynistred the same to the poore people oonelie
for neighbourhode and Goddes sake,
and of pite and <span class="xxpn" id="p191">{191}</span>
charytie; and it is nowe well knowen that the surgeons
admytted wooll doo no cure to any persone, but where
they shall knowe to be rewarded with a greater soome
or rewarde than the cure extendeth unto, for in cace they
wolde mynistre theyre coonning to sore people unrewarded,
there shoulde not so manye rotte and perishe to
deathe for lacke of helpe of surgerye as dailie doo.”
Besides, in spite of the examinations by the Bishop of
London, “the most parte of the persones of the said
crafte of surgeons have small coonning.” For which
cause all the king’s subjects who have, “by speculacion
or practyse,” knowledge of the virtues of plants, roots,
and waters, may as before, notwithstanding enactments
to the contrary, cure any malady apparent on the surface
of the body, by means of plasters, poultices, and ointments
“within any parte of the realme of Englande, or
within any other the kinges dominions.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn242" id="fnanc242">242</a></p>

<p>A radical change, as we see; the secrets and “speculacions”
of country people were no longer those of
sorcerers, but precious recipes which they had received
from God by intuition; the poor, subject to die without
a doctor, rejoiced, the quacks breathed once more—but
were led again onto the boards of the comic stage just
as before. Ben Jonson, that bold pedestrian who walked
all the way from London to Scotland, and who, in his long
rambles through villages or cities, had become familiar
with the variegated characters haunting their market places,
painted, in his turn, the portrait of the “mountebank
doctor,” one of the best, not better however than Rutebeuf’s,
and very similar to it, for, as we said, the type
passed on from century to century, unchanged.</p>

<p>Old Ben, as usual, paints from life, having seen and
heard more than once at Bartholomew and other fairs
the drug-seller pacing his scaffold and exclaiming, “O,
health, health! the blessing of the rich! the
riches of the <span class="xxpn" id="p192">{192}</span>
poor! who can buy thee at too dear a rate, since there is
no enjoying this world without thee.” Upon which the man
makes game of the despicable “asses” his rivals, boasts
of his incomparable panacea, into which enters a little
human fat, which is worth a thousand crowns, but which
he will part with for eight crowns, no, for six, finally for
sixpence. A thousand crowns is what the cardinals
Montalto and Farnese and his friend the Grand Duke
of Tuscany have paid him, but he despises money and
he makes sacrifices for the people. Likewise he has a
little of the powder which gave beauty to Venus and to
Helen; one of his friends, a great traveller, found it in
the ruins of Troy and sent it him. This friend also sent
a little of it to the French Court, but that portion had
become “sophisticated,” and the ladies who use it do
not obtain from it such good results.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn243" id="fnanc243">243</a></p>

<p>Three years later, an English traveller, finding himself
at Venice, was filled with wonder at the talk of the
Italian mountebanks, and describing them, he too, from
life, gave another copy of the same immutable original.
“Truely,” wrote Coryat, “I often wondered at many of
these natural orators. For they would tell their tales
with such admirable volubility and plausible grace, even
<i>extempore</i>, and seasoned with that singular variety of
elegant jests and witty conceits, that they did often strike
great admiration into strangers that never heard them
before.” They sell “oyles, soueraigne waters, amorous
songs printed, apothecary drugs, and a common-weale of
other trifles. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I saw one of them holde a viper in his
hand, and play with his sting a quarter of an houre together,
and yet receive no hurt. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He made us all beleeve
that the same viper was lineally descended from the generation
of that viper that lept out of the fire upon St. Paul’s
hand, in the island of Melita, now
called Malta.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn244" id="fnanc244">244</a>
<span class="xxpn" id="p193">{193}</span></p>

<p>No doubt the loquacity, the volubility, the momentary
conviction, the grace, the insinuating tone, the light,
winged gaiety of the southern charlatan were not found
so fully or so charmingly at the festivals of old England.
These festivals were, however, merry and boisterous,
attended by large crowds, among which moved many an
artful character so full of jest and guile that Shakespeare
thought them worthy of immortality; he gave it them
indeed in creating, as a model of those men whose
“revenue is the silly cheat,” his incomparable “Autolycus,
a rogue.”</p>

<p>Country labourers went in numbers to these meetings,
to stand jests which, aimed at them, were an amusement
even to themselves, and to buy some drug which would do
them good: they are to be seen there still. At the present
day they continue to collect before the vendors of cures
for the toothache and other troubles. Certificates abound
round the booth; it seems as though all the illustrious
people in the world must have been benefited by the discovery;
the man now addresses himself to the rest of
humanity. He talks, gesticulates, gets excited, leans
over with a grave tone and a deep voice. The peasants
press around, gaping with inquisitive eye, uncertain if
they ought to laugh or to be afraid, and in the end get
confident. The large hand fumbles in the new coat,
the purse is drawn forth with an awkward air, the piece
of money is held out and the medicine received, while
the shining eye and undecided physiognomy say plainly
that the cunning and the habitual practical sense are here
at fault; that these good souls, clever and invincible in
their own domain when it is a question of a sheep or a
cow, are the victims of every one in an unknown land,
the land of medical lore. The vendor bestirs himself,
and now, as formerly, triumphs over indecision by means
of direct appeals.</p>

<p>In England the incomparable
Goose Fair at <span class="xxpn" id="p194">{194}</span>
Nottingham should be chosen as the place to see these spectacles,
which shine there in all their infinite variety, with quacks
as racy as those of pristine days, scenes reminding one
of Rubens’ great “Kermesse” at the Louvre, and at
every turn and before every shop living confutations of
St. Evremond and others’ ideas of the temper of the
English, ever lost in their thoughts, as if merry England
were no more.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn245" id="fnanc245">245</a></p>

<p>Greater still was, in the Middle Ages, the popularity
of those wayfarers, numerous too at the Goose Fair, who
came not to cure, but to amuse, and who, if they did not
offer remedies for diseases, at least brought forgetfulness
of troubles; the minstrels, tumblers, jugglers, and singers.
Minstrels and <i>jongleurs</i>, under different names, exercised
the same profession, that is, they chanted songs and
romances to the accompaniment of their instruments, as
is still done in the East, in Persia for instance, where
poems are not told but chanted, in various keys according
to the subject. At a time when books were rare, and
the theatre, properly so called, did not exist, poetry and
music travelled with the minstrels and gleemen along the
roads; such guests were always welcome. They were
to be found at every feast, wherever there were rejoicings;
it was expected from them, as from wine or beer, that care
would be lulled to sleep, and merriment would replace it.
They had many ways to fulfil the expectation, some dignified,
some not. Of the first sort was the singing and
reciting, either in French or English, of the loves and
deeds of ancient heroes.</p>

<p>This was a grand part to play, one held in much
reverence; the harpers and minstrels who arrived at the
castle gates, their heads full of war stories, or sweet
tales, or lively songs to excite laughter, “ad ridendum,”
were received with the highest favour. On their coming
they announced themselves without by some “murie <span
class="xxpn" id="p195">{195}</span> singing” overheard in
the house; soon came the order to bring them in; they were
ranged at one end of the hall, and every one gave ear to
them.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn246" id="fnanc246">246</a>
They preluded on their instruments, and then began to sing.

<p>In the fourteenth century most of these old romances,
heroic, forceful, or touching, had been re-cast and put
into new lan­guage; florid de­scrip­tions, com­pli­cat­ed
ad­ven­tures, marvels and prod­i­gies had been added to them;
many had been turned into prose, and instead of being
sung they were read.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn249"
id="fnanc249">249</a> The lord listened with pleasure, and
his taste, palled by surfeit, caused him to take delight
in the strange entangle­ments with which every event was
hence­forth enveloped. He now lived a more complex life
than formerly; being more refined he had more wants, and
grand, simple pictures in poems like the Song of Roland
no longer satisfied his imag­i­na­tion: he preferred variety
to grandeur. The heroes of romance <span class="xxpn"
id="p197">{197}</span> found harder and harder tasks
imposed on them, and were obliged to triumph over more
and more marvellous en­chant­ments. As the hand became more
alert the modelling improved; the softer-hearted heroes
of amorous adven­tures were endowed by the poet with that
charm, at once mystic and sensual, so characteristic of
the sculptured figures of the fourt­eenth cen­tury. The
author of “Sir Gawayne” takes a scarcely con­cealed pleasure
in describing the visits which his knight receives, in
painting his lady, so gentle, so pretty, with easy motions
and gay smile; he puts into his picture all his art, all
his soul; he finds words which seem caresses, and verses
which shine as with a golden gleam.<a class="afnanc"
href="#fn250" id="fnanc250">250</a></p>

<p>These pictures, not rare in the thirteenth century,
greatly multiplied in the fourteenth, but toward the end
thereof passed from the romance into the tale, or into
poems, half tale, half romance, such as the “Troilus”
of Chaucer. After many transformations the metrical
romance was gradually giving way to new forms and
styles which better suited the tastes of the hour. A
hundred years earlier such a man as Chaucer would have
taken up the Arthur legends in his turn, and would have
written some splendid long-winded poetical romance for
the minstrels; but he left us tales and lyric poems because
his own taste and that of the age were different, and he
felt that people were still curious but not enthusiastic
about old heroic stories, that few any longer followed
them with passion to the end, and that they were rather
made the ornament of libraries than the subject of daily
thought.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn251" id="fnanc251">251</a>
Thenceforward men liked to
find separately in <span class="xxpn" id="p198">{198}</span>
ballads and in tales the lyric breath and the spirit of
observation formerly contained with all the rest in the
great metrical romances, the poetical <i>summæ</i> of earlier
days; and these, abandoned to the less expert of the
itinerant rhymers, became such wretched copies of the
old originals that they were the laughing-stock of people
of sense and taste.</p>

<p>Many of the grand French epics were thus abridged
and put into skipping, barren English verse, the epics
being out of fashion, their substitutes valueless. So, when
Chaucer, surrounded by his fellow pilgrims, favoured
them with a story of Sir Thopas, popular good sense,
personated by the host, rebelled, and the performance
was rudely interrupted. Yet from Sir Thopas to many
of the romances which ran the streets or the roads the
distance is small, and the laughable parody was hardly
more than a close imitation. Robert Thornton, in the
first half of the fifteenth century, copied from older
texts a good number of these remodelled romances. In
turning their pages one is struck by the excellence of
Chaucer’s jesting, his caricature being almost a portrait.</p>

<p>These poems are all cut after one and the same pattern,
tripping and sprightly, with little thought and less sentiment;
the cadenced stanzas march on, clear, easy, and
empty; no constraint, no effort; one may open and
close the book without a sigh, without regret, with no
positive weariness nor really-felt pleasure. Were it not
for the proper names, the reader might pass chancewise
from one romance to another without noticing the change.
Take no matter which, “Sir Isumbras”
for example: <span class="xxpn" id="p199">{199}</span>
after a prayer for form’s sake, the rhymer vaunts the
valour of the hero, then praises a quality of especial value,
with which he was happily endowed, his fondness for
minstrels and his generosity towards them:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>He

</div></div>

<p>Isumbras, his wife, and his son, are without peers;
he is the most valiant of knights, his wife the most lovely
of women:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">

 class="afnanc" href="#fn252" id="fnanc252">252</a>
<span class="xxpn" id="p200">{200}</span></div>
</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">So is also Chaucer’s Sir Thopas:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">

<div class="dpp00">In batail and in tornament,</div>
<div class="dpp02">His name was Sir Thopas.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>And though Sir Thopas almost comes within the
scope of the present work, being an adventure seeker,
“a knight auntrous,” ever on his way, never sleeping in
a house—</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>No

</div></div>

<p>But, even at a com­par­a­tive­ly late date, the inmate of
an out of the way castle usually proved more lenient. He
welcomed the minstrel, his verse and his viol as he welcomed
change; he lent a complacent ear to his commonplace
romances, his ballads on every subject, his praise
of flowers, women, wine, spring, heroes and saints, his
<i>goliardic</i> dispraise of women,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn253" id="fnanc253">253</a>
monks and friars, his
tales of love or laughter, his patriotic songs the rarest of
all, for the Hundred Years War was for the English chiefly
a royal and not a national war, and this alone can explain
the scant place occupied in the songs of the
time by Crécy <span class="xxpn" id="p201">{201}</span>
and Poictiers, never mentioned by Chaucer, never mentioned
by Langland (who disapproved of the war), celebrated
only by one solitary songster known by name
and otherwise unknown, the unimitated and ungifted
Laurence Minot.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn254" id="fnanc254">254</a>
The noble listened; he had few
intellectual diversions; he gave little time if any to reading,
which was not for him then an unmixed pleasure, and
needed effort; there was no theatre for him to go to.
At long intervals only, when the great yearly feasts came
round, the knight might go, in company with the crowd,
to see Pilate and Jesus on the boards. There he found
sometimes not only the crowd but the king too. Richard II,
for example, witnessed a religious play or mystery in the
fourteenth year of his reign, and had ten pounds distributed
among several clerks of London who had played
before him at Skinnerwell “the play of the Passion and of
the creation of the world.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn255" id="fnanc255">255</a>
A few years later he saw
the famous York plays, at the feast of Corpus Christi,
performed in the streets of that city.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn256" id="fnanc256">256</a>
In ordinary times
the knight was only too happy to receive in his home
men of vast memory, who knew more verse and more
music than could be heard in a day.</p>

<p>The king himself liked their coming. He had them
sometimes brought up to him in his very chamber, where
he was pleased to sit and hear their music. Edward II
received four minstrels in his chamber at Westminster
and heard their songs, and when they went he ordered
twenty ells of cloth to be given them for their reward.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn257" id="fnanc257">257</a>
No one thought in those days of rejoicings without minstrels;
there were four hundred and
twenty-six of them <span class="xxpn" id="p202">{202}</span>
at the marriage of the Princess Margaret, daughter of
Edward I.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn258" id="fnanc258">258</a>
Edward III gave a hundred pounds to those
who were present at the marriage of his daughter Isabella,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn259" id="fnanc259">259</a>
some figured also at his tournaments.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn260" id="fnanc260">260</a>
When a bishop
went on his pastoral rounds he was occasionally greeted
by minstrels, hired on purpose to cheer him; they were
of necessity chosen among local artists, who were apt
to fiddle cheap music to his lordship. Bishop Swinfield,
in one of his rounds, gave a penny a piece to two minstrels
who had just played before him; but on another occasion
he distributed twelve pence a piece.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn261" id="fnanc261">261</a></p>

<p>When men of importance were travelling they sometimes
had the pleasure of hearing minstrels at the inn,
and in that manner whiled away the long empty evenings.
In the curious manual already quoted, called “La manière
de langage,” composed in French by an Englishman of
the fourteenth century, the traveller of distinction is
represented listening to the musicians at the inn, and
mingling his voice at need with their music: “Then,”
says our author, “come forward into the lord’s presence
the trumpeters and horn-blowers with their frestels (pipes)
and clarions, and begin to play and blow very loud, and
then the lord with his squires begin to move, to sway,
to dance, to utter and sing fine carols till midnight without
ceasing.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn262" id="fnanc262">262</a></p>

<p>In great houses minstrels’ music was the usual seasoning
of meals. At table there are
only two amusements, <span class="xxpn" id="p203">{203}</span>
says Langland, in his “Visions”: to listen to the minstrels,
and, when they are silent, to talk religion and to
scoff at its mysteries.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn263" id="fnanc263">263</a>
The repasts which Sir Gawain takes
at the house of his host the Green Knight are enlivened
with songs and music. On the second day the amusement
extends till after supper; they listen during the
meal and after it to many noble songs, such as Christmas
carols and new songs, with all possible mirth:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpp09">“Mony athel songez,</div>
<div class="dpp00">As coundutes of kryst-masse, and carolez newe,</div>
<div class="dpp00">With all the manerly merthe that mon may of telle.”</div>
</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">On the third day,</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>With
 merthe and mynstralsye, with metez at hor wylle,</div>
<div class="dpp00">Thay maden as mery as any men moghten.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn264" id="fnanc264">264</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>In Chaucer’s “Squire’s Tale,” King Cambynskan
gives a</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpp04">“Feste so solempne and so riche</div>
<div class="dpp00">That in this worlde ne was ther noon it liche.”</div>
</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">And this prince is shown sitting after the third course
among his nobles, listening to the music:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
 So bifelle after the thridde cours,</div>
<div class="dpp00">Whil that the kyng sit thus in his nobleye,</div>
<div class="dpp00">Herkyng his mynstrales her thinges pleye</div>
<div class="dpp00">Byforn him atte boord deliciously.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>During all these meals the sound of the viol, the voice
of the singers, the “delicious things” of the minstrels,
were interrupted, it is true, by the crunching
of the bones <span class="xxpn" id="p204">{204}</span>
gnawed by the dogs under the tables, by the quarrels
of the same, or by the sharp cry of some ill-bred falcon;
for many noblemen kept during dinner these favourite
birds on a perch behind them. Their masters, enjoying
their presence, were indulgent with the liberties they
took.</p>

<p>The minstrels of Cambynskan are represented as
attached to his person; those belonging to the King of
England also had permanent functions. The sovereign
was seldom without them, and even when he went abroad
was accompanied by them as well as by his hawks and
hounds, a complete orchestra. Henry V engaged eighteen,
who were to follow him to Guyenne and elsewhere.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn265" id="fnanc265">265</a>
Their chief is sometimes called <i>king</i> or <i>marshal</i> of the
minstrels.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn266" id="fnanc266">266</a>
On May 2, 1387, Richard II gave a passport
to John Caumz (? Camuz), “rex ministrallorum
nostrorum,” who was setting out for a journey beyond
the sea.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn267" id="fnanc267">267</a>
On January 19, 1464, Edward IV grants
a pension of ten marks “to our beloved Walter Haliday,
marshall of our minstrels.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn268" id="fnanc268">268</a>
The Roll of Thomas Brantingham,
treasurer to Edward III, bears frequent mention
of royal minstrels, to whom a fixed salary of seven pence-halfpenny
a day is paid.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn269" id="fnanc269">269</a>
King Richard II had in the
same manner minstrels in his pay, and
enjoyed their music <span class="xxpn" id="p205">{205}</span>
when travelling. When he went for the last time to
Ireland he had to wait for ten days at Milford on account
of contrary winds. That French gentleman, Créton, who
was with him, and wrote afterwards a most interesting
account of what befell the unfortunate king during the
last year of his reign, states in his chronicle that the time
was merrily passed at Milford while expecting a change
in the weather, and that day and night they had music
and songs of minstrels.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn270" id="fnanc270">270</a></p>

<p>The richer nobles imitated, of course, the king, and
had their own companies, whom they allowed to play at
times in various parts of the country (as was the case
later with regular actors), and whom they supplied with
testimonial letters vouching for them and their artistic
ability.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn271" id="fnanc271">271</a>
The accounts of Winchester College under
Edward IV show that this college recompensed the services
of minstrels belonging to the king, the Earl of
Arundel, Lord de la Ware, the Duke of Gloucester, the
[Earl] of Northumberland, and the Bishop of Winchester;
these last often recur. In the same accounts, time of
Henry IV, mention is made of the expenses occasioned
by the visit of the Countess of Westmoreland, accompanied
by her suite. Her minstrels formed part of it, and a sum
of money was given them.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn272" id="fnanc272">272</a>
<span class="xxpn" id="p206">{206}</span></p>

<p>When visiting towns and performing before the citizens,
itinerant troups made a collection among the bystanders,
having, however, themselves a fee to pay for the privilege.
A curious example of this is recorded in John of Gaunt’s
register,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn273" id="fnanc273">273</a>
where his seneschal of
Newcastle-under-Lyme is ordered to see to it that 4d. be
paid to William de Brompton a burgess of that city and
Margery his wife, “by every minstrel coming there to make
his minstralcy against the feast of St. Giles the Abbot,”
and that a payment be also made to the same for every
bear brought there to be baited, a regular inquest having
shown that such fees had been paid to that couple and to
Margery’s ancestors from time immemorial.</p>

<p>Like lords and princes, from the early fifteenth century
at least, cities themselves had their troups of minstrels:
“London, Coventry, Bristol, Shrewsbury, Norwich,
Chester, York, Beverley, Leicester, Lynn, Canterbury,
had them, to name no others. They received fixed fees
or dues, wore the town livery and badge of a silver
scutcheon, played at all local celebrations and festivities
and were commonly known as <i>waits</i>.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn274" id="fnanc274">274</a></p>

<p>Besides money and good meals, those musical wanderers
often received a variety of gifts, such as cloaks,
furred robes, and the like. Langland alludes more than
once to these largesses, which proves that they were
considerable, and he regrets that all this was not distributed
to the poor who go, they too, from door to door,
and are the minstrels of God: <span class="xxpn" id="p207">{207}</span></p>

<p>But his advice was not heeded, and long after his time
the min­strels con­tinued to be ad­mit­ted to the castle halls.
In erect­ing the hall the builder took into ac­count the
prob­able visits of mu­si­cians, and often raised a gal­lery
for them above the en­trance door, op­po­site to the dais, the
place where the master’s table was set.<a class="afnanc"
href="#fn276" id="fnanc276">276</a> This cus­tom long
survived the Mid­dle Ages. At Hat­field a min­strels’ gal­lery
of the seven­teenth cen­tury adorns the hall of that
beaut­i­ful place, and is still, on great oc­ca­sions, put to
the use it was orig­i­nal­ly in­tended for.</p>

<p>The classic instrument of the minstrel
was the <i>vielle</i>, a kind of violin or fiddle with
a bow, something like ours, a drawing of
which, as used in the thir­teenth cen­tury,
is to be found in the album of Villard de
Honne­court.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn277" id="fnanc277">277</a>
It was delicate to handle, and
required much skill; in pro­por­tion there­fore
as the pro­fes­sion lowered, the good
per­former on the <i>vielle</i> became rarer; the
common tam­bour­ine or tabor, which needed
but little training, replaced the <i>vielle</i>, and
true artists complained of the music and the
taste of the <span class="xxpn" id="p208">{208}</span>
day. It was a tabor that the glee-man of Ely wore at
his neck when he had his famous dialogue with the King
of England, which proved so bewildering for the monarch:
“He came thence to London; in a meadow he met the
king and his suite; around his neck hung his tabor,
painted with gold and rich azure.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn278" id="fnanc278">278</a></p>

<p>The minstrels played yet other instruments, the harp,
the lute, the guitar, the bag-pipe, the rota (a kind of small
harp, the ancient instrument of the Celts), and others.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn279" id="fnanc279">279</a></p>

<div class="dcaption">39. THE MINSTRELS’ GALLERY AT EXETER.
<div class="fsz6">(<i>Fourteenth Century.</i>)</div>
</div></div>

<p>The presents, the favour of the great, rendered enviable
the lot of the minstrels; they multiplied accordingly,
and the competition was great, which made the trade less
profitable. In the fifteenth century, the king’s minstrels,
clever and able men, protested to their master against
the increasing audacity of the false minstrels, who
deprived them of the greater part of their revenues.
“Uncultured peasants,” said the king, who sided with
his own men, “and workmen of different trades in our
kingdom of England have passed themselves off as minstrels;
some have worn our livery, which
we did not <span class="xxpn" id="p211">{211}</span>
grant to them, and have even given themselves out to be
our own minstrels.” By means of these guilty practices,
they extorted much money from the king’s subjects, and
although they had no understanding nor experience of
the art, they went from place to place on festival days
and gathered all the profits which should have enriched
the true artists, those who had devoted themselves entirely
to their profession, and did not exercise any low trade.</p>

<p>The king, to protect his men against such un­law­ful
comp­e­ti­tion, au­thor­ized them to re­con­sti­tute and con­sol­i­date
the pre-exist­ing gild of minstrels; no one could
hence­forth exercise this pro­fes­sion, whatever his talent,
if he had not been admitted into the gild. A power of
inquiry was granted to the members of the society, who
had the right to have false minstrels fined, the money
to be applied to candles lit in the chapel of the Holy Virgin
at St. Paul’s and in the “royal free chapel of St. Anthony.”
For a pious motive was associated then with most actions,
and minstrels, so badly treated by the generality of religious
writers, were in this case bound, says the king, to pray in
those two chapels for him while alive and for his soul when
dead, for his “dearest consort Elizabeth queen of England,”
and for the soul of his “dearest lord and father”;
this till the end of time. Women were, as well as men,
admitted into the fraternity.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn280" id="fnanc280">280</a></p>

<p>Such was the will of the king; in the same manner,
and without any better success, the price of bread and
the wage for a day’s labour were lowered by statute, all
of which had but a limited
and temporary effect. <span class="xxpn" id="p212">{212}</span></p>

<p>The authorities had other reasons for watching over
singers and itinerant musicians; while they showed
indulgence to the armed retainers of the great, they feared
the rounds made by those glee men with no other arms
than their vielle or tabor, but sowing sometimes strange
disquieting doctrines under colour of songs. These were
more than liberal, and went at times so far as to recommend
social or political revolt. The Commons in parliament
denounced by name, at the beginning of the fifteenth
century, the Welsh minstrels as fomentors of trouble and
causes of rebellion. Their political songs encouraged
the insurgents to resistance; and parliament, who bracketed
them with ordinary vagabonds, knew well that in
having them arrested on the roads, it was not simple cut-purses
whom it sent to prison. “<i>Item</i>: That no westours
and rimers, minstrels or vagabonds, be maintained in
Wales to make kymorthas or quyllages on the common
people, who by their divinations, lies, and exhortations
are partly cause of the insurrection and rebellion now in
Wales. <i>Reply</i>: Le roy le veut.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn281" id="fnanc281">281</a></p>

<p>Popular movements were the occasion for satirical
songs against the great, songs composed by minstrels
and soon known by heart among the crowd. It was a
popular song which furnished to John Ball the text for
his famous speech at Blackheath in the revolt of 1381:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>When
 Adam delved and Eve span,</div>
<div class="dpp00">Who was then the gentleman?”</div>
</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">Again, under Henry VI, when the
peasants of Kent rose, and their allies the sailors took
and beheaded the Duke of Suffolk at sea, a satirical song
was composed, became popular and has come down to us. As
before killing him they had given a mock trial to the
king’s favourite, so in the song they present the comedy
of his funeral; <span class="xxpn" id="p213">{213}</span>
nobles and prelates are asked to come and sing their
responses, and in this pretended burial service, which
is in reality a hymn of joy and triumph, the minstrel
calls down heavenly blessings on the murderers. At
the end the Commons are represented coming in their
turn to sing a sarcastic <i>Requiescant in pace</i> over
all English traitors.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn282"
id="fnanc282">282</a></p>

<p>The renown of the popular rebel, Robin Hood the
outlaw, who lived in the twelfth century if he ever lived
at all, went on increasing. His manly virtues were extolled;
picturesque companions were, later, invented for
him: Friar Tuck, Maid Marian, Little John and all the
imaginary inhabitants of Sherwood Forest; listeners were
told how this pious man, who, even in the worst danger,
waited till mass was over before thinking of his safety,
boldly robbed great lords and high prelates, but was
merciful to the poor;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn283" id="fnanc283">283</a>
which was an indirect notice to
the brigands of the time that they should be careful to
discern in their rounds between the tares and the
wheat.</p>

<p>The sympathy of the minstrels for ideas of emancipation,
which had made such progress in the fourteenth
century, was not only evinced in these songs, but also
in the remodelled romances recited by them in presence
of the nobles, and which henceforth were full of high-flown
declarations on the equality of men. The hearer
did not take offence; the greater poets, favourites of
all that counted, the king himself in his public statements
proclaimed liberal truths which it was hardly
expected would be acted upon
literally. Thus Chaucer <span class="xxpn" id="p214">{214}</span>
celebrates in his most eloquent verse the only true nobility
in his eyes, that which comes from the heart.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn284" id="fnanc284">284</a>
Thus
also King Edward I, on summoning the first true English
parliament in 1295, declared that he did so inspired by
the old maxim which prescribes that what concerns all
should be approved by all, proclaiming a principle whence
have since issued the most radical reforms of society, and
on which the American insurgents founded, centuries
later, their claim to independence.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn285" id="fnanc285">285</a></p>

<p>Such direct appeals from the king to his people contributed
early to develop among the English the sense
of duty, of political rights and responsibilities. In days
of trouble, when parliament scarcely yet existed, the same
king thought he should explain his conduct to the people
and allow them to form an opinion: “The king about
this, and about his estate and as to his kingdom, and how
the business of the kingdom has come to naught, makes
known and wishes that all should know the truth of it;
which ensues&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn286" id="fnanc286">286</a></p>

<p>In France the enunciation of liberal principles was
frequent in royal edicts, but the emptiness of these fine
words and the interested motives which
caused them to <span class="xxpn" id="p215">{215}</span>
be used were scarcely veiled at all. Louis X, “le Hutin,”
in his ordinance of July 2, 1315, declares that, “as according
to the law of nature every one is born free,” he has
resolved to enfranchise the serfs on his own estates. He
adds, however, that he will do so for money. Three days
later, fearing that his benefit is not sufficiently prized, he
supplements his first statement by a new one in which
his exalted ideas and his present needs are boldly intertwined:
“It may be that some, ill-advised and in default
of good counsel, might misunderstand such great benefit
and favour and wish rather to remain in the baseness of
servitude than to come to free estate: wherefore we
order and commit to you that, <i>for the aid of the present war</i>,
you levy on such persons according to the amount of
their property, and the conditions of servitude of each
one, as much and sufficiently as the condition and riches
of those persons may bear and as the necessity of our
war may require.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn287" id="fnanc287">287</a></p>

<p>Well then might the minstrels imitate the king himself
in repeating axioms so well known, and which, according
to appearance, there was so little chance of seeing carried
out. But ideas, like the seeds of trees falling on the soil,
are not lost, and the noble who had gone to sleep to the
murmur of verses chanted by the glee-man waked up one
day to the tumult of the crowd collected before London,
with the refrain of the priest John Ball for its war-cry.
And then he had to draw his sword and show by a massacre
that the time was not yet come to apply these axioms, and
that there was nothing in them save song.</p>

<p>Still were the trees dropping their seeds. Poets
and popular singers had thus an influence over social
movements, less through the maxims scattered throughout
their great works than by those little unpolished pieces,
struck off on the moment, which the lesser among them
composed and sang for the people, at the cross-roads
in <span class="xxpn" id="p216">{216}</span> times of
trouble, or by the peasants’ hearth in ordinary times, as
a reward for hospitality.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn288"

</div></div>

<p>Minstrels, however, as singers of songs, pro­pa­ga­tors
of thoughts, tellers of romances, were to disappear. An
age was be­gin­ning when books and the art of reading
spread among the people, and a more and more numerous
public would read and cease to listen; the theatres were,
moreover, about to offer a spectacle much superior to that
of the little troop of musicians and wandering singers,
and would compete with them more power­ful­ly than the
“rude hus­band­men and art­i­fic­ers of various crafts,”
against whose im­pert­i­nence Ed­ward IV was so in­dignant.
Re­placed, un­want­ed, the mins­trels proper ceased to
exist as a class, leaving how­ever behind them a variety of
men who could claim them as ancestors, street mu­si­cians,
mirth mon­gers, or the “blind crouder with no rougher voice
then rude stile,” who sang for Sir Philip Sidney “the olde
song of Percy and Douglas.”</p>

<p>In fact, the period of the Taillefers who would go
to death in the fight while singing of Charle­magne
was a limited one; the lustre which the jongleurs or
trouvères of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, who
confined themselves to the recitation of poetry, had shed
on their profession, was effaced in proportion as they
associated <span class="xxpn" id="p217">{217}</span>
more closely with the mannerless bands of tumblers,
jugglers, leaders of performing bears (<i>ursinarii</i>, the
Latin documents of the time name them),<a class="afnanc"
href="#fn289" id="fnanc289">289</a> conjurors, and
ribalds of all kinds.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn290"
id="fnanc290">290</a></p>

<p>These bands had always existed, but the chanters of
romances, tellers of knights’ high deeds, and of saints’
edifying examples, admitted even into the cloister, finding
grace before St. Thomas Aquinas,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn291" id="fnanc291">291</a>
had, in the heyday
of their fame stood above them, or apart from them. At
all times, however, in castles and at fairs, were to be found
buffoons and jugglers, whose coarseness exhilarated the
spectators. The precise details which the contemporaries
give as to their performances show not only that their
jokes would not be tolerated among the rich of to-day,
but that there are even few out of the
way villages where <span class="xxpn" id="p218">{218}</span>
peasants on a festival would accept them without disgust.
The great of former days found pleasure, however, in
them, and in the troop of mummers and tumblers who
went about wherever mirth was wanted, there always
were some who excited laughter by the ignoble means
described in John of Salisbury’s “Polycraticus”—“so
shameful that even a cynic would blush at seeing them.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn292" id="fnanc292">292</a>
But people of high degree did not blush, they laughed.
Two hundred years later, some sacrilegious clerks, out
of hate for the Archbishop of York, made themselves
guilty of the same monstrous buffooneries in his very
cathedral, and the episcopal letter relating their misdeeds
with the precision of a legal report, adds that they were
committed <i>more ribaldorum</i>.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn293" id="fnanc293">293</a>
Langland, at the same epoch,
shows that one of his personages is not a true minstrel,
either of the higher or of the lower sort, since he is neither
able to “telle faire gestes,” nor to practise those welcome
turpitudes.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn294" id="fnanc294">294</a></p>

<p>The greater was the feast, the coarser were often the
deeds and songs of the mirth-mongers. In this way, in
particular, were they accustomed to celebrate Christmas.
Thomas Gascoigne, in the sort of theological dictionary
compiled by him, beseeches his readers to abstain from
hearing such Christmas songs, for they leave on the mind
images and ideas which it is almost impossible afterwards
to wash out. He adds as a warning the story of a man
he personally knew: “I have known, I, Gascoigne,
Doctor in Divinity, who am writing this book, a man
who had heard at Christmas some of
those repulsive songs. <span class="xxpn" id="p219">{219}</span>
It so happened that the shameful things he had heard
had made such a deep impression on his mind that he
could never in after time get rid of those remembrances
nor wipe away those images. So he fell into such a deep
melancholy that at length it proved deadly to him.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn295" id="fnanc295">295</a></p>

<div class="dcaption">41. FAVOURITE DANCES IN MEDIÆVAL ENGLAND.
<div class="fsz6">(<i>From MS. 10 E. IV.</i>)</div>
</div></div>

<p>The representations of the dance of Salome to be
found in mediæval stained glass or manuscripts give an
idea of the sort of tricks and games considered the fittest
to amuse people of importance while sitting in their hall
or having their dinner. It is by dancing on her hands,
head downwards, that the young woman gains the suffrages
of Herod. As the idea of such a dance could not be
drawn from the Bible, it obviously arose from the customs
of the time. At Clermont-Ferrand, in the stained glass
of the cathedral (thirteenth century), Salome dances on
knives which she holds with each hand, she also having
her head downwards. In a window at the Lincoln cathedral
she has no knives, but her “dance” is of the same
sort and her red-stockinged feet touch the upper line
of the glass panel. At Verona, she is
represented on the <span class="xxpn" id="p220">{220}</span>
most ancient of the bronze gates of St. Zeno (ninth century)
bending backwards and touching her feet with her
head. Those standing by are filled with surprise and
admiration, one puts his hand to his mouth, the other to
his cheek, in an involuntary gesture of amazement. She
may be seen in the same posture in several manuscripts
in the British Museum; Herod is sitting at his table
with his lords, while the young woman dances head downwards.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn296" id="fnanc296">296</a>
In another manuscript, also of the fourteenth
century, minstrels are shown playing on their instruments,
while a professional dancing girl belonging to their troop
performs as usual head downwards, but this time, as at
Clermont, her hands rest on two swords. The accounts
of the royal exchequer of England sometimes mention
sums paid to passing dancers, who, no doubt, must also
have performed surprising feats, for the payments are
considerable. Thus, in the third year of his reign,
Richard II pays to John Katerine, a dancer of Venice,
six pounds thirteen shillings and fourpence for having
played and danced before him.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn297" id="fnanc297">297</a></p>

<div class="dcaption">42. FAVOURITE DANCES IN PERSIA.
<div class="fsz6">(<i>From a pencil-case.</i>)</div>
</div></div>

<p>In the East, where, in our travels, we have sometimes
the surprise of finding ancient
customs still living <span class="xxpn" id="p221">{221}</span>
which we can at home only study in books, the fashion
for buffoons and mimics survives, and even remains the
great distraction of princes. The Bey of Tunis, when
I was there years ago, had fools to amuse him in
the evening, who insulted and diverted him by the contrast
between their permitted insolence and his real power.
Among the rich Moslem women of the same city, few of
whom could read, the monotony of days spent by them
till death came under the shadow of the same walls, behind
the same gratings, was broken by the tales of the female
fool, whose duty was to enliven the harem by sallies of
the strangest liberty. As for dances, they frequently
consist, in the East, in performances similar to that of
Salome, such as shown in our manuscripts. Women
dancing head downwards constantly appear in Persian
pictures; several examples may be seen in the Victoria
and Albert Museum, and the same subject often occurs
on the valuable pencil-cases formerly made with so much
taste and art in Persia.</p>

<p>If our ancestors of the fourteenth century could enjoy
such pleasures, no wonder that moralists declared more
and more openly against both minstrels and mimics and
ranked them with those rogues and vagabonds denounced
as a public danger by parliament. As years pass the
discredit grows. In the sixteenth century Philip Stubbes
saw in minstrels the personification of all vices, and he
justified in bitter words his contempt for “suche drunken
sockets and bawdye parasits as range the cuntreyes, ryming
and singing of uncleane, corrupt and filthie songes in
tavernes, ale-houses, innes, and other publique assemblies.”
Their life is like the shameful songs of which their heads
are full, and they are the origin of all abominations; the
more dangerous because their number is so great:</p>

<p>“Every towne, citie, and countrey is full of these
minstrelles to pype up a dance to the devill: but of
dyvines, so few there be as they maye
hardly be seene. <span class="xxpn" id="p222">{222}</span></p>

<p>“But some of them will reply, and say, What, sir!
we have lycences from justices of peace to pype and use
our minstralsie to our best commoditie. Cursed be those
lycences which lycence any man to get his lyving with
the destruction of many thousands!</p>

<p>“But have you a lycence from the archjustice of
peace, Christe Jesus? If you have not .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. than may
you, as rogues, extravagantes, and straglers from the
heavenlye country, be arrested of the high justice of
peace, Christ Jesus, and be punished with eternall death,
notwithstanding your pretensed licences of earthly men.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn298" id="fnanc298">298</a></p>

<p>Such was the state of degradation the noble pro­fes­sion
of the old singers had reached; the necessity either of
ob­taining a licence or of joining a gild, as prescribed by
Edward IV, had been powerless to check the decay. With new
man­ners and in­ven­tions their <i>raison d’être</i> dis­ap­peared;
the ancient reciters of poems, after having mingled with
the dis­re­put­able troops of cat­er­ers to public amuse­ment,
saw these troops survive them, and, regular players apart,
there hence­forth only re­mained upon the roads those
coarse buf­foons, bear­wards, and vul­gar music makers whom
thoughtful men held as re­pro­bates.</p>

<p class="pfirst">All his life long, kind, loving, merry Chaucer, a
good observer, a good listener and good talker,
was fond of travels and travellers, of roamers and
tale-tellers, of people who came from afar, bringing home
with them many stories if little money, stories in which
much invention no doubt was mingled with a little truth:
but what is the good of raising a protest against harmless
invention? Is not sometimes their mixture with
“sooth” a pleasant one? Thus, he said:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">

types and rare ones; he observed mine Host, and looked
also for seekers of adventure, and was never tired of
hearing their tales: <span class="xxpn" id="p224">{224}</span></p>

<p class="pcontinue">He was in this a real <i>connoisseur</i>, fully appreciating the
merit of a well-told fable and knowing how useful and
pleasant some such may be found to beguile slow-winged
time. Long before he started from the Tabard, “faste
by the Belle,” for a journey which millions of Englishmen
have since performed at his heels, allured by the
music or merriment of his word, he had this same taste
for “unkouthe syghtes and tydynges,” as well as for
“thinges glad.” Finding himself once in great “distresse”
of mind, with a heavy heart, “disesperat of all
blys,” what did he dream of to “solace” himself, but
of meeting and hearing the whole innumerable tribe of
tale-tellers, wayfarers, and adventure seekers, by fancy
assembled in an immense house, “made of twigges, salwe,
rede and green eke?” He wanted us to know,
and he wrote of the “House of Fame,” where after
having met the bard “that bare of Thebes up the fame”
(Statius), and “gret Omere,” and “Venus’ clerke Ovide,”
“Englyssh Gaunfride” (of Monmouth, of Arthurian
fame), and many more, he thought that there was no
room for him, and feeling his distress as keen as ever,
dreamed of something else, willing</p>

<p id="p225">In this he had full satisfaction; his dream took
another turn, and he was led towards the place he wanted,
where things glad were to be found, a temple not of fame,

<p class="pcontinue">War and peace, and love and travels, all this he was
to make in after-time the subject of his “Canterbury
Tales,” and he represents himself in this earlier poem
as if coming to the well and spring of all tales,
placed somewhere in the land of dreams and fancy, yet
surrounded by people who were neither fanciful nor
dreamy creatures, but bony beings, on the contrary, with
strong muscles and alert tongues, and the dust of the
road to Rome or the East on their feet; surrounded,
in fact, by these very roamers we are now trying to call
up one by one from the past, and who receive in the
“House of Fame” such an apotheosis as befits their
quaint if rather questionable
character. Good Chaucer <span class="xxpn" id="p226">{226}</span>
lends a willing ear, and the ways of speech of these people
are carefully preserved in his verse for those who after
him may find interest in them. In this manner they

<p>That there may be no mistake about the sort of people
to whom the pleasant art of stretching a lie is so familiar,
Chaucer is careful to name them, and there we find almost
every one of our friends already mentioned or hereafter
described, the sea or land wayfarers:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>And

</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">What Chaucer gathered from these shipmen, pardoners,

<p>Whether or not some doubt may have afterwards
entered his mind about the great poetical faculty of
“folke,” certain it is that, for the delight of future ages,
he did not stick to his word, as every reader of the
“Canterbury Tales” well knows.</p>

<div class="dcaption">45. A PROFESSIONAL MESSENGER.
<div class="fsz6">(<i>From the MS. 10 E. IV.</i>)</div>
</div></div>

<p>These “boystes” which Chaucer represents, carried
by messengers and couriers, were filled in the way he
describes only in a metaphorical sense, and this left
room for more solid ware, for letters and parcels too,
since in those old simple days, the messengers were the
only equivalent for mail and for parcels post. They were
to be found in the service of abbots, bishops, nobles,
sheriffs, courts of justice,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn300"
id="fnanc300">300</a> and of the king. Such a costly
forerunner of the post was not, of course, available for
everybody; people did as they best could. The poor man
<span class="xxpn" id="p228">{228}</span> waited till
some friend was going a journey; the rich only had express
messengers, entrusted with their errands to distant
places and with the carrying of their letters, generally
written at dictation by a scribe on a sheet of parchment,
and then sealed in wax with the master’s signet.<a
class="afnanc" href="#fn301" id="fnanc301">301</a> The
king kept twelve messengers with a fixed salary; they
followed him everywhere, in constant readiness to start;
they received threepence a day when they were on the
road, and four shillings and eightpence a year to buy
shoes.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn302" id="fnanc302">302</a>
They were entrusted with letters <span class="xxpn"
id="p229">{229}</span> for the kings of France and
Scotland; sent to call together the representatives of the
nation for Parliament; to order the publication of the
papal sentence against Guy de Montfort; to call to Windsor
the knights of St. George; to summon the “archbishops,
earls, barons, and other lords and ladies of England and
Wales” to London to be present at the funeral of the late
queen (Philippa); to prescribe the proclamation in the
counties of the statutes made in Parliament; to command the
“archbishops, bishops, abbots, priors, deans, and chapters
of the cathedral churches of all the shires to pray for
the soul of Anne, late Queen of England, deceased.”<a
class="afnanc" href="#fn303" id="fnanc303">303</a></p>

<p>Edward III sends messengers or heralds to foreign
parts, viz., France, Germany, Brabant, Flanders, Scotland,
to call the nobility of these countries to a great tournament,
a sort of international match to be held on St.
George’s Day. The amount of the expense so incurred,
which is not less than thirty-two pounds, shows that the
messengers must have had long protracted journeys and
must have had to visit every part of the countries allotted
to each of them.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn304" id="fnanc304">304</a></p>

<p>Sometimes the king got into trouble with his Commons
on account of expenses for messengers, which he
did not always feel inclined to pay from his own purse.
Such a case happened in 1378, and the Commons took
this opportunity to once more assert
their views about <span class="xxpn" id="p230">{230}</span>
the French and other foreign possessions of their sovereign,
Ireland being included among them. They plainly state,
as they had before, that these countries and the expenses
concerning them are a matter for the king, not for them;
it is a sort of kingly luxury with which they will have
nothing to do. They remonstrate, therefore, that about
forty-six thousand pounds sterling have been spent and
entered as an item of national expense “for the safeguard
of certain countries, places and fortresses, for which
the Commons ought in no way to be charged. These
are partly in the march of Calais and partly at Brest, Cherbourg,
in Gascony, and in Ireland; and also expenses
over certain messengers to Flanders, Lombardy, Navarre,
and Scotland.”</p>

<p>The Government peremptorily refuses to accept this
kind of reasoning, and returns a spirited reply: “To
which it was answered that Gascony and the other forts
which our lord the king has in the parts beyond, are and
must be as barbicans for the kingdom of England, and
if the barbicans are well kept, with the safeguard formed
by the sea, the kingdom will be secure of peace. Otherwise
we shall never find rest nor peace with our enemies;
for then they would push hot war to the thresholds of
our houses, which God forbid. Besides, through these
barbicans our said lord the king has convenient gates
and entrances towards his enemies to grieve them when
he is ready and can act.” Telling reasons are also given
for retaining among public expenses the costs of the
journeys of messengers north and south.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn305" id="fnanc305">305</a>
None the
less did the Commons of England long continue to
consider the French wars, glorious perhaps, but undoubtedly
expensive, as a personal quarrel of their sovereign,
and as, in fact, little more than a rivalry between two
French sovereigns speaking the same language and belonging
to the same family. <span class="xxpn" id="p231">{231}</span></p>

<p>Besides letters, couriers and messengers had many
strange parcels to carry from one place in the country
to another: presents to fair ladies, commodities of all
sorts for their own masters. Thus, in the year 1396, we
find a servant of the Duke de Berri sent as a messenger
to Scotland, and travelling all the way thither from France
across England to fetch certain greyhounds of which
his master was especially fond. He is accompanied by
three men on horseback, to help him in taking care
of the hounds, and he carries a safe-conduct from
Richard II, to travel without hindrance through the
English dominions with his followers and their belongings.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn306" id="fnanc306">306</a></p>

<p>Among the missions given by the king to his servants
are some which, at the present day, would seem singularly
repugnant. He might, for instance, charge one of his
faithful retainers to carry the quarters of a criminal’s
body executed for treason to the great towns of England.
In this case he did not employ simple messengers;
they were personages of trust, followed by an escort to
convey the remains. Thus Edward III, in the fifty-first
year of his reign, paid not less than twenty pounds to
“Sir William de Faryngton, knight, for the costs and
expenses he had incurred for transporting the four quarters
of the body of Sir John of Mistreworth, knight, to different
parts of England.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn307" id="fnanc307">307</a></p>

<p>Of all travellers, the messenger was the swiftest;
first, because travelling was his business; he was a good
horseman, an experienced person, clever in getting out
of trouble on the road and at the inns; then he had the
right of way; woe to whoever thought to stop him;
there were immense fines if the master were powerful,
still more if the man were the king’s messenger. A
messenger of the queen, who had
been imprisoned by <span class="xxpn" id="p232">{232}</span>
the constable of Roxburgh Castle, did not hesitate to
claim £10,000 sterling for contempt of his sovereign,
and £2,000 as indemnity for himself.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn308" id="fnanc308">308</a></p>

<p>When, on August 7, 1316, Jacques d’Euse, cardinal-bishop
of Porto, was chosen pope at Lyons, and assumed
the name of John XXII, Edward II being at York learnt
the news ten days afterwards through Laurence of Ireland,
messenger of the house of the Bardi. And indeed
we find by the accounts of the king’s household that this
prince paid Laurence twenty shillings on the 17th of
August to reward him for his trouble. It was only on
the 27th of September that, being still at York, the king
received by Durand Budet, a messenger of cardinal de
Pelagrua, the official letters announcing the election;
he gave five pounds to the messenger. Finally, the
pope’s nuncio having arrived in person shortly afterwards,
bearing the same news no longer so fresh, the king made
him a present, inversely proportionate to his speed, of
a hundred pounds.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn309" id="fnanc309">309</a></p>

<p>Such was the custom, presents were made to the
bringers of good news; royal messengers had thus a
chance of casually increasing their meagre pay of threepence
a day. Most fortunate were those who brought
word to the king himself of happy events. Edward III
gave a forty marks pension for life to the queen’s messenger
who came announcing the birth of the Prince of Wales,
the future Black Prince; he gave thirteen pounds, three
shillings and fourpence to John Cok of Cherbourg, who
told him of the capture of King John at Poictiers; he
settled a pension of one hundred shillings upon Thomas
of Brynchesley who brought him the good news of the
capture of Charles of Blois.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn310" id="fnanc310">310</a>
<span class="xxpn" id="p233">{233}</span></p>

<p>Sometimes messengers, in spite of their privileges and
cleverness, were liable to find themselves in very difficult
plight. In time of war they had to conceal their real
function, and were in constant danger of being stopped
and having their bag searched and their letters opened.
People felt strongly about foreigners living in England,
many of them being friars who might disclose the secrets
of the realm in their private correspondence. The
Commons therefore asked for very strict rules to be passed
in order to remedy this possible evil, and we find them,
in the year 1346, when England was at war with France,
recommending the creation of something like the <i>cabinets
noirs</i> of a later date.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn311" id="fnanc311">311</a></p>

<p>Langland in his “Visions” graphically compares
the different modes of travelling of messengers and such
other wayfarers as merchants going with their goods
from one place to another. The one is the swiftest
of all, no one would dare to stop him; the other
is retarded by his pack, his debts, his fear of robbers
which prevents his travelling at dark, the impossibility
for him to use short cuts across the
fields, while short <span class="xxpn" id="p234">{234}</span>
cuts are freely allowed to messengers: no hayward
would disturb them; no man in his senses, no “wys
man” would “wroth be” on account of his crops being
spoiled by a messenger; the messenger shows his letters
and is free to go:</p>

</div></div>

<p>Wayfarers there were in whom both characteristics
were united, the slowness of pace of the merchant and
the lightness of heart of the messenger. These were
the pedlars, a very numerous race in the Middle Ages,
one of the few sorts of wanderers that have not yet entirely
disappeared. A jovial race they seem to have been;
they are so now, most of them, for their way to success
is through fair speech and enticing words; and how
could they be enticing if they did not show good humour
and jollity? “Gaiety” mends their broken wares, and
colours the faded ones, and blinds
customers to otherwise <span class="xxpn" id="p235">{235}</span>
obvious defects. They have always been described thus;
they were merry and sharp-tongued; such was Shakespeare’s
Autolycus; such is, in a novel of our time, the
jovial owner of the dog Mumps, Bob Jakin of “The
Mill on the Floss.” “&#x200a;‘Get out wi’ you, Mumps,’ said
Bob, with a kick; ‘he is as quiet as a lamb, sir’—an
observation which Mumps corroborated by a low growl,
as he retreated behind his master’s legs.” About the
exact scrupulousness prevailing among the tribe the
opinion has perhaps not been quite so consistent, which
is the best that can be said for it.</p>

<p>One good point about them, however, is that in
mediæval England, whatever may have been their reputation,
they entirely escaped legislation. Very possibly
they were impliedly included in statutes against vagrants
and rovers; but they may at least argue that as a matter
of fact they are not named in any Act of Parliament, and
pass unobserved or nearly so by the Westminster legislator
down to a com­par­a­tive­ly recent date. They are
for the first time named in a statute during the reign of
Edward VI, in which, it is true, they are treated in a
contemptuous manner, being described as more “hurtful
than necessary to the common wealth.” This is called
“an acte for tynkers and pedlers,” and is to the following
effect: “For as muche as it is evident that tynkers,
pedlers and suche like vagrant persons are more hurtfull
than necessarie to the Common Wealth of this realm,
Be it therefore ordeyned .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. no person or
persons commonly called pedler, tynker or pety chapman
shall wander or go from one towne to another or from
place to place out of the towne, parishe or village where
such person shall dwell, and sell pynnes, poyntes, laces,
gloves, knyves, glasses, tapes or any suche kynde of wares
whatsoever, or gather connye skynnes or suche like things
or use or exercise the trade or occupation of a tynker,”
except those that shall have a licence
from two justices <span class="xxpn" id="p236">{236}</span>
of the peace; and then they will be allowed to travel
only in the “circuyte” assigned to them.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn313" id="fnanc313">313</a></p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth, too, had a word for pedlars, and it
was not more complimentary than what her brother
had to say about them, although “scollers of the Universityes”
joined them on her list of disreputable roamers.
They figure in her “Acte for the punishment of
vacabondes”; and a very curious list of wanderers is
found in it: “It ys nowe publyshed,” says the queen,
“that .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all ydle persones goinge aboute in any
countrey of the said Realme, using subtyll craftye and
unlawfull games or playes, and some of them fayninge
themselves to have knowledge in phisnomye, palmestrye,
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and all fencers, bearwardes, comon players in interludes
and minstrels not belonging to any baron of this
realme .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. all juglers, pedlars, tynkers, and petye chapmen
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and all scollers of the Universityes of Oxford
or Cambridge y<sup>t</sup> goe about begginge .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and all shipmen
pretendinge losses by sea .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. shalbee deemed roges
vacabounds and sturdy beggers intended of by this present
act.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn314" id="fnanc314">314</a>
But the case of pedlars was not seriously taken
in hand before the reign of William III who put a tax
upon them and, ominously enough, bound them to certify
commissioners for transportation how they travelled and
traded.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn315" id="fnanc315">315</a></p>

<p>The late date of this statute of pedlars, if it may be
called so, is the more remarkable that they swarmed along
the roads in the Middle Ages, more numerous than
tinkers or any other wandering representatives of petty
trades. There were not then as now large shops in every
village with all the necessaries of life ready provided for the
inhabitants. The shop itself was itinerant, being nothing
else than the pack of travelling chapmen. In
the same way <span class="xxpn" id="p237">{237}</span>
as the literature propagated by the minstrels, as news,
tales, and letters, pardons from Rome and many other
commodities, so household wares were carried about
the country by indefatigable wayfarers. A host of small
useful things, or sometimes useless, but so pleasing! were
concealed in their unfathomable boxes. The contents
of them are pretty well shown by a series of illuminations
in a fourteenth-century manuscript, where a pedlar is
represented asleep at the foot of a tree, while monkeys
have got hold of his box and help themselves to the contents.
They find in it vests, caps, gloves, musical instruments,
purses, girdles, hats, cutlasses, pewter pots, and
a number of other articles.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn316" id="fnanc316">316</a></p>

<p>As to the means by which pedlars came by their
goods, a variety seem to have been used by them, and
purchase was only one among several. A proverbial
saying preserved for us by Langland shows how they
secured furs for their country customers. The author
of the “Visions” states how Repentance came once to
Avarice, and examined him as to his usurious doings:</p>

<div class="dpoemfarlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>&#x200a;‘Hastow
 pite on pore men · that mote nedes borwe?’</div>
<div class="dpp00">‘I have as moche pite of pore men · as
 pedlere hath of cattes,</div>
<div class="dpp00">That wolde kille hem, yf he cacche hem
 myghte · for coveitise of here skynnes.’&#x200a;”<a class="afnanc"
 href="#fn317" id="fnanc317">317</a></div>
</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">a practice which cannot fail to be deeply resented by all
lovers of cats.</p>

<p>The regular merchants whom Langland and Chaucer
describe, so splendid to look at that no one knew they
were “in dette,” adorned with Flaundrish hats and “botes
clasped faire and fetisly,” were a very
different sort of <span class="xxpn" id="p238">{238}</span>
people; but though no mere wanderers, they were, too,
great wayfarers. Many of them had had to visit the
continent to find markets for their goods, and for their
purchases. Through them too, and it was in fact, perhaps,
the safest and most reliable among many such channels of
information, ideas of what was going on in the outer world
and how things were managed in France and elsewhere,
points of similitude and comparison, were introduced
into England and made the subject of thought and
discussion.</p>

<div class="dcaption">46. A PEDLAR ROBBED BY MONKEYS.
<div class="fsz6">(<i>From MS. 10 E. IV.</i>)</div>
</div></div>

<p>During the fourteenth century the foreign trade of
England had greatly increased; there was a constant
intercourse with Flanders, with Bruges above all other
towns, for the sale of home produce: wools especially,
and woolfels, cheese, butter, tin, coal,<a class="afnanc"
href="#fn318" id="fnanc318">318</a> etc., with the <span
class="xxpn" id="p239">{239}</span> Rhine country,
with Gascony, with Spain, for the purchase of wines;<a
class="afnanc" href="#fn319" id="fnanc319">319</a> with the
Hanse towns, Lombardy, Venice, and the East. Unintelligent
regulations constantly interfered, it is true, with this
development, but so strong was the impulse that it went on
steadily. One of the most persistent and most noxious of
these regulations was the prohibition to export money or
bullion, which governments were never tired of renewing.<a
class="afnanc" href="#fn320" id="fnanc320">320</a> English
merchants were forbidden, when purchasing goods in foreign
countries, to pay for them with money; they had to pay
in kind, with wools, cheese and other home produce,
which of course might or might not be found acceptable
by the vendor. It was, in other words, forbidden to use
money as a means of facilitating exchange, which is its
very <i>raison d’être</i>, and people had to return to the
primitive practice of <i>troc</i>, or exchange in kind. It had
sometimes worse effects than that of impeding transactions;
foreign merchants might, as once did the Flemings, show
their appreciation of the rules imposed on their English
purchasers by answering their proffer of wools and
cheese with a beating and imprisonment until they would
alter their laws or their minds. For <span class="xxpn"
id="p240">{240}</span> which treatment, English merchants
sent doleful complaints to Parliament. In such cases
retaliation upon Flemings in England might be demanded,
but no thought was entertained, even by the injured
party, of repealing laws considered as an indispensable
safeguard for the kingdom.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn321"
id="fnanc321">321</a></p>

<p>Not much wiser were the rules applied to merchant
shipping, made worse by constant change, a defect which
was noticeable in every trade regulation of that time.
Some are curious as being an attempt to establish the
long lived, but more moderate rules devised by Cromwell
in 1651: “Item, to increase the navy of England which
is now greatly diminished, it is assented and accorded,
that none of the king’s liege people do from henceforth
ship any merchandize in going out or coming within
the realm of England in any port, but only in ships of
the king’s liegeance.” But the very next year this impossible
statute was altered so as to practically annul it:
“It is ordained and granted that the said ordinance only
have place as long as ships of the said ligeance in the
parts where the said merchants happen to dwell be found
able and sufficient.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn322" id="fnanc322">322</a>
The same unsteadiness of purpose
was shown in almost every branch of the yet unbaptized
science of political economy.</p>

<p>Not less worthy of notice than this attempt at a
Navigation Act is the claim made, even then, by the
Commons of England to a traditional supremacy over
the seas. In one of their innumerable petitions concerning
the decay of the navy, which seems to have been
a favourite complaint in England from the remotest period
down to our own time, they state that the
rash and often <span class="xxpn" id="p241">{241}</span>
useless pressing of ships for the king’s service had brought
about a most dangerous decrease of the navy; many
mariners addicting themselves to other trades, while only
“twenty years ago, <i>and always before</i>, the shipping of the
Realm was in all the ports and good towns upon the sea
or rivers, so noble and plenteous that all the countries
held and called our said sovereign: the King of the Sea
(<i>le Roi de la Mier</i>).”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn323" id="fnanc323">323</a>
As these were trading ships, only
occasionally used for war purposes, this gives an idea
of the importance to which British merchant shipping
had risen in the fourteenth century and which it desired
to recover.</p>

<p>The rules concerning foreign merchants coming to
England were in the same manner constantly changed;
sometimes the hardest restrictions were put upon them,
and sometimes everything was done to allure them to
come. The result was the same; trade was impeded
doubtless, but it went on, and in spite of the unsteadiness
of legislation, of retaliatory measures (as
when, for instance, Hanse merchants were imprisoned in
England and their goods seized on account of misdeeds
committed by Prussians, “ceux de la seigneurie de Pruys,”
no reason of complicity being alleged, but only it seems one
of geographical vicinity<a class="afnanc" href="#fn324" id="fnanc324">324</a>), in spite of restrictions innumerable,
the intercourse steadily increased, to the great benefit
of the community and the wider diffusion of ideas. In
the ninth, the twenty-fifth, the twenty-seventh, and other
years of his reign, King Edward III again and again
stated that he took foreign merchants under his special
protection: “To replenish the said realm and lands,”
he said on one of these occasions,
“with money and <span class="xxpn" id="p242">{242}</span>
plate, gold and silver and merchandises of other lands,
and to give courage to merchants strangers to come with
their wares and merchandises into the Realm and lands
aforesaid, we have ordained and established that all
merchants strangers which be not of our enmity, of what
land or nation that they be, may safely and surely, under
our protection and safe conduct, come and dwell in our
said realm and lands, where they will, and from thence
[freely] return,” selling their goods to whom they please,
being exempted from purveyance and only paying the
ordinary customs.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn325" id="fnanc325">325</a>
If war is declared between England
and their country, they will have forty days to quit the
realm, during which time they shall be allowed to continue
their sales, and even more delay will be allowed
them in case they are ill, or are detained by bad weather.
This last was, as we have seen, a very necessary proviso,
for a merchant coming with his goods in the depth of
winter to a broken bridge might be stopped a rather long
time; as also if, reaching the sea-coast, he found contrary
winds. The statute of the twenty-fifth year provided
that the liberal intentions of the king towards foreign
merchants should be brought by way of proclamation
to the notice of the officers and inhabitants of all the
English counties, trading cities, seaports, etc.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn326" id="fnanc326">326</a></p>

<p>Thus protected and impeded by turns, foreign trade
jogged on, and as common interest was, after all, stronger
than popular prejudice and narrow regulations, it managed
to thrive in England. Foreign gilds were established
in London; foreign settlements were created in several
trading towns,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn327" id="fnanc327">327</a>
foreign fleets visited
the English coasts <span class="xxpn" id="p243">{243}</span>
at regular intervals, none with more important results
than the fleet of the Venetian Republic. It began to
call regularly at the ports of Flanders, England, and the
North, in the year 1317; each ship had on board thirty
archers for its defence, commanded by young Venetian
noblemen. There was in the fourteenth century a
Venetian consul at Bruges, and the commander of the
galleys did not fail to put himself in communication with
him. The fleet, or “galleys of Flanders,” as it was called,
brought to England cotton from Egypt, cloth of silk
from Venice, cinnamon, pepper, cloves, saffron, camphor,
musk, and other drugs or spices from the East, sugar
from Egypt and Sicily, etc. The trade of Venice in
the eastern Mediterranean was very extensive; it was
carried on freely, except during occasional wars with
the Saracens, and the commercial interest that the Italian
Republics had in the continuation of a good understanding
with the infidel was one of the principal causes of the
cessation of crusades. From England the Venetian galleys
took back wools and woollen cloths, leather, tin, lead,
sea-coal, cheese,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn328" id="fnanc328">328</a>
etc.</p>

<p>The importance of this intercourse with the continent,
which fortunately the variations in the laws of
the land were unable to check, gave prominence in the
community to the English merchant. He is already in
the fourteenth century, and has been ever since, one of
the main supports of the State. While the numerous
applications of Edward III to Lombard bankers for ready
money are well known, it is sometimes overlooked how
often he had recourse to English merchants, who supplied
him with that without which his archers’ bows would have
remained unstrung. The advice and
goodwill of the <span class="xxpn" id="p244">{244}</span>
whole class of merchants could not be safely ignored;
therefore their attendance was constantly requested at
Westminster to discuss money and other State matters.
Some families among them rose to eminence, like the
De la Poles of Hull, who became earls of Suffolk with
descendants destined to die at Agincourt, to be checked
by Joan of Arc at Orleans, to be made dukes, and
to be impeached for high treason. It was, too, the time
of “thrice Lord Mayor of London”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn329" id="fnanc329">329</a>
Dick, afterwards
Sir Richard Whittington, who, if we trust the legend,
did not entertain the same feeling as the above-mentioned
pedlars for cats. Another man of the same sort a little
later was the famous William Canynge, of Bristol, who
made a large fortune there in trading with foreign
countries. One of his ships was called the <i>Mary Redcliffe</i>,
a name as well as his own since associated with the memory
of the Bristol boy-poet, Thomas Chatterton.</p>

<p>The feeling that the king of England should be <i>le
Roi de la Mier</i> goes on increasing. The “Libelle of
Englyshe Polycye,” a sort of consular report, written
however in verse, about 1436, is quite positive:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Kepte
 (keep) than the see about in specialle,</div>
<div class="dpp00">Whiche of England is the rounde walle;</div>

id="fnanc330">330</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>And those traditions having been continued, Montesquieu
was able to write, in his “Esprit des Lois”: “Other
nations have made the interests of commerce yield to
political interests. England has always made her political
interests yield to her commercial ones. <span class="xxpn"
id="p245">{245}</span></p>

<p>“This is the people in the world that has best known
how to avail itself of these three great things: religion,
commerce, and liberty.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn331"

<div class="dcaption">47. A RICH MERCHANT TRAVELLING (CHAUCER’S MARCHAUNT).
<div class="fsz6">(<i>From the Ellesmere MS.</i>)</div>
</div></div>

<p>Below men in such exalted situations as a Whittington
(praised to the skies in the “Libelle”) or a Canynge,
the bulk of the merchant community throve as best they
could. One of the necessities of their avocation was
constant travelling. They were to be met along the
roads almost as much as their poorer brothers the pedlars.
They also made great use of the water-courses, and
carried their goods by boat whenever possible. Hence
the constant interference of the Commons with the erection
of new mills, weirs, and other hindrances on rivers by the
owners of the adjoining lands. The “Rolls of Parliament”
are full of petitions asking for the complete suppression
of all new works of this sort as being detrimental
to the “common passage of ships and boats on the great
rivers of England,” or stating that
“the merchants who <span class="xxpn" id="p246">{246}</span>
frequent the water between London and Oxford used to
have free passage on the Thames from London to
Oxford, with their ships to carry their goods and to serve
the commonalty and the people, but now they are disturbed
by weirs, locks, mills, and many other hindrances.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn332" id="fnanc332">332</a>
The reasons why merchants preferred such a conveyance
were that the cost of carriage was less; that, save for the
occasional meeting of unexpected locks and weirs, they
were more certain than on ordinary roads to find before
them a clear course; and that they were better able to
protect themselves against robbers.</p>

<p>They could not, however, go everywhere by water,
and willingly or not they had then to betake themselves
to the roads, and incur all the mischances that might
turn up on the way or at the inn. In his “Visions,”
Langland describes how one of his mischievous characters
once rifled at the inn the boxes of travelling chapmen:</p>

<div class="dpoemfarlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span
class="spquotebox">“</span>&#x200a;‘Thus, ones I was
herberwed,’ quod he · ‘with an hep of chapmen,</div>

<div class="dpp00">I roos whan thei were arest (having
their rest) · and yrifled here males’&#x200a;” (their
trunks).</div>
</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">Repentance, who had just been asking if his interlocutor
had never made “restitucioun,” wonders at this strange
statement as to how things went on at the inn:</p>

<div class="dpoemfarlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span
class="spquotebox">“</span>That was no restitucioun, quod
Repentance · but a robberes thefte.”</div>
</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">To which the careless creature retorts in a way that
reminds one of Chaucer’s French of Stratford-atte-Bow:</p>

<div class="dpoemfarlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span
class="spquotebox">“</span>&#x200a;‘I wende (believed)
ryflynge were restitucioun,’ quod he · ‘for I lerned nevere
rede on boke,</div>
<div class="dpp00">And I can no Frenche in feith · but of
the ferthest end of Norfolke.’&#x200a;”<a class="afnanc"
href="#fn333" id="fnanc333">333</a></div>
</div></div>

<p id="p247">Between the “male” of these chapmen and the mere
pack of the pedlar the difference is not considerable;
it is not very great either if compared to the “male”
of the merchant we have met before, who travels slowly
on account of an encumbrance represented by the poet as
the emblem of “men that ben ryche.” So that these
three links kept pretty close together the chain of the
itinerant trading community. They all had to go about
and to experience the gaieties or dangers of the road,
the latter being of course better known to the richer sort
than to the poor Bob Jakin of the day. The reasons
for this constant travelling were numerous; the same
remark applies to merchants of the fourteenth century
as to almost all other classes: there was much less journeying
than to-day for mere pleasure’s sake, but very
much more, com­par­a­tive­ly, out of necessity. We cannot
underrate the causes of personal journeys suppressed by
the post and telegraph (and telephone, unheard-of when
the present work was first published), with the money
and other facilities they have introduced. But besides
the lack thereof, the staple and fairs were, in the fourteenth
century, potent causes impelling merchants to
move about.</p>

<p>The staple was the subject of constant regulations,
complaints, new regulations and new complaints. The
fundamental law concerning it is the well-known statute
of 1353, the mechanism of which the following extracts
will show:</p>

<p>“We (i.e. the king and Parliament) have ordained
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. first, that the staple of wools, leather, woolfels,
and lead, growing or coming forth within our said realm
and lands, shall be perpetually holden at the places underwritten,
that is to say, for England at Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
York, Lincoln, Norwich, Westminster, Canterbury,
Chichester, Winchester, Exeter, and Bristow; for Wales
at Kaermerdyn; and for Ireland
at Dublin, Waterford, <span class="xxpn" id="p248">{248}</span>
Cork, and Drogheda, and not elsewhere; and that all
the said wools, as well old as new, woolfels, leather,
and lead, which shall be carried out of the said realm and
lands shall be first brought to the said staples, and there
the said wool and lead, betwixt merchant and merchant
or merchant and others, shall be lawfully weighed by the
standard; and that every sack and sarpler of the same
wools so weighed be sealed under the seal of the mayor
of the staple.”</p>

<p>Any English may bring and sell wool at the staple;
but only foreign merchants are allowed to take it out of
the realm. It is prohibited to stop carriages and goods
going to the staple. It is ordained also “that in every
town where the staple shall be holden, shall be ordained
certain [streets] and places where the wools and other
merchandises shall be put; and because that the lords
or guardians of the houses and places, seeing the
necessity of merchants do set percase their houses at
too high ferm, we have ordained that the houses which
be to be leased in such manner, shall be set at a reasonable
ferm,” after the estimation of the local authority,
assisted by four discreet men of the place.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn334" id="fnanc334">334</a>
It need
scarcely be said that the staple was often removed from
one town to another, from England to Calais and from
Calais to England, etc., according to inscrutable whims
and fancies, and with very detrimental results for all
traders.</p>

<p>The fairs, the very name of which can scarcely fail
to awaken ideas of merry bustle, gay clamour, and joyous
agitation, were subjected to no less stringent regulations,
so that the word reminded many people not merely
of pleasure but also of fines,
confiscations, and prison. <span class="xxpn" id="p249">{249}</span>
When the time came for a fair, no sale was permitted
in the town except at the fair, under pain of the goods
exhibited being seized. All the ordinary shops were
to be closed. Such regulations were meant not only
to insure the largest possible attendance at the fair, but
also to secure for the lord of it the entirety of the tolls
he had a right to.</p>

<p>An inquest holden at Winchester, famous for its
St. Giles’s fair, gives an idea of the manner in which
these commercial festivities were solemnized. The fair
belonged to the Bishop of Winchester. On the eve
of St. Giles’s Day, at early dawn, the officers of the
bishop went about the town announcing the conditions
of the fair, which were these: no merchant was to sell
or exhibit for sale any goods in the town, or at a distance
of seven leagues round it, except inside the gates of the
fair. The same proclaimed the assise of bread, wine,
and ale; tasted the wine, broke the casks where they
detected “insufficient” wine. They proved all weights
and measures; they destroyed false ones and fined the
owners. All merchants were to reach the fair not later
than a certain time (the feast of the Nativity of the Virgin
Mary); if they came later they were not admitted except
with a special licence from the bishop. The usual allowance
is made in case they may have been kept back by
a storm at sea, or by some mischance on land, “infortunium
in terra,” which in this time of bad roads, and
of such determined robbers as Sir Robert de Rideware,
was not infrequent. A court of “pie powder,” that is, “of
the dusty feet,”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn335" id="fnanc335">335</a>
was held in the fair itself, and any suit
arising from transactions or trouble
there was determined <span class="xxpn" id="p250">{250}</span>
by this tribunal at once, and without appeal. Similar rules
were in existence at the Westminster fair, and at many
others.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn336" id="fnanc336">336</a>
The importance of these meetings is shown
by the constant recurrence in the “Rolls of Parliament”
of petitions concerning them, beseeching the king to
grant a fair to a certain lord or to a certain town, or to
suppress a neighbouring town’s fair, for fear it may hurt
the petitioners’ own.</p>

<p>People from the counties and from the continent
flocked to the fairs. The largest and the more widely
known were those of Winchester,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn337" id="fnanc337">337</a>
Abingdon for cattle,
Bartholomew fair<a class="afnanc" href="#fn338" id="fnanc338">338</a>
in Smithfield (London), Stourbridge
fair, the most important of all, Weyhill, mentioned in
Langland’s “Visions,”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn339" id="fnanc339">339</a>
etc. In the
time of Elizabeth, <span class="xxpn" id="p251">{251}</span>
Harrison, describing England, could not help expressing
his pride in the importance and renown of English fairs,
about which he writes thus: “As there are no great
towns without one weekelie market at the least, so there
are verie few of them that have not one or two faires or
more within the compasse of the yeare, assigned unto
them by the prince. And albeit that some of them are
not much better than Lowse faire or the common Kirkemesses
beyond the sea, yet there are diverse not inferiour
to the greatest marts in Europe, as Sturbridge faire neere
to Cambridge, Bristow faire, Bartholomew faire at London,
Lin mart (Linne), Cold faire at Newport pond for cattell,
and diverse other.” In all of which people were kept
merry with ales and beers of various flavour and strength
known by as significant names as those of present day
dances, fox-trot, mother’s rest, and others, which to-morrow
will, they too, need interpretation: “Such headie
ale and beere in most of them, as for the mightinesse
thereof .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is commonlie called huffe cap, the mad dog,
father whoresonne, angels food, dragon’s milke, go by the
wall, stride wide, and lift leg. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Neither did Romulus
and Remus sucke their shee wolfe (or sheepheards wife)
Lupa, with such eger and sharpe devotion, as these men
hale at huf cap, till they be red as cockes and little wiser
than their combs.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn340" id="fnanc340">340</a></p>

<p>Stourbridge fair belonged to the city and corporation
of Cambridge, and was held in September, lasting three
weeks. Tents and wooden booths were erected at that
time on the open fields, so as to form streets; each trade
had its own street as in real cities, and as may still be seen
now in the bazaars of the East. Among the principal
articles sold at this fair were:
“ironmongery, cloth, <span class="xxpn" id="p252">{252}</span>
wool, leather, books.” The last article became in several
fairs an important one when the art of printing spread;
there was in the North Hundred of Oxford, in the sixteenth
century, a fair at which an extensive sale of books
took place, and this, as Professor Thorold Rogers has
observed, is the only way to account for the rapid diffusion
of books and pamphlets at a time when newspapers and
advertisements were practically unknown. “I have more
than once,” adds the same authority, “found entries of
purchases for college libraries, with a statement that the
book was bought at St. Giles’ fair.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn341" id="fnanc341">341</a>
No reader of
Boswell needs to be reminded how the father of Dr.
Johnson had a booth for book selling on market days
at Uttoxeter, in doing which he was merely keeping up,
as we see, a mediæval tradition of long standing. How
young Samuel refused once to accompany his father to
the market, and, in after-time, repaired on a rainy day
to the spot, and there did penance, has been alluded to
before.</p>

<p>Even at the present day books continue to be an
article of sale at the fairs in many French villages, and
sheets of printed matter are taken from thence to cottages,
where, under the smoky light burning in winter by the
fireside, people, not very dissimilar to their forefathers
of five hundred years ago, look at the image of mediæval
heroes and of the worthies of the world, by the side of
whom now begins to appear that of the heroes of the
Great War.</p>

<p>To the fairs, along with mummers, jugglers, tumblers,
beggars, and the whole of the catchpenny tribe, the pedlar
was sure to resort, in the approved Autolycus fashion.
“He haunts,” says the clown in “Winter’s Tale,”
“wakes, fairs, and bear-baiting.” There he might exhibit
“ribands of all the colours i’ the
rainbow; points, more <span class="xxpn" id="p253">{253}</span>
than all the lawyers in Bohemia can learnedly handle,
though they come to him by the gross; inkles, caddisses,
cambricks, lawns. Why, he sings them over, as they
were gods or goddesses; you would think a smock were
a she-angel, he so chants to the sleeve hand, and the work
about the square on’t.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn342" id="fnanc342">342</a>
So that everybody might
remark, as does the honest clown to fair Perdita, “You
have of these pedlars that have more in them than you’d
think, sister.” A favourable view, adopted, magnified,
sublimated by another great poet whose Wanderer is a
pedlar, but what a pedlar and what a part does he not
play in the community!</p>

<h3 class="h3chap">CHAPTER III
<span class="hbig">
OUTLAWS, WANDERING WORKMEN, AND
PEASANTS OUT OF BOND</span></h3>

<p class="pfirst">The mountebanks, the musicians, and their fellows
have stayed us at the street corners, in the castle
halls and courtyards; the pedlars have led us to
the peasants’ cots, the fairs and markets. With the outlaws
we must leave the highroad for the pathless woods,
fens and solitudes.</p>

<p>England at that time was not the immense meadow,
furrowed by railways, of the present day; there still
remained much of those forests spoken of by Cæsar in
his Commentaries, and where the Plantagenet kings and
their predecessors had so jealously maintained their rights
of the chase. The woods were not so well policed as
they are now; they offered to bandits and men fleeing
from justice a more extensive asylum than any six-circled
sanctuary. In the popular mind the idea of
the great rustling forest, and the idea of
the free life <span class="xxpn" id="p255">{255}</span>
that the outlaws led there, were often mingled in one
and the same sentiment of sympathy. Besides, therefore,
the praise of the Arthurian heroes, is found in the poetry
of the time that of the trees and bushes, that of the valiant
men who, dwelling in the copse, were supposed to have
struggled for the public liberties, Hereward, Fulk Fitz-Warin,
Robin Hood. Were a man pursued, if the
sanctuary was too far or not to his taste, he took to the
forest; it was easier to get there, he remained nearer
to his kin, and was about as safe as if he had crossed
over to the continent.</p>

<p>Robbers, bandits, poachers, knights in trouble might
thus meet as comrades in the depths of the wood. The
forest is the first thought of the proscribed squire in the
“Nut Brown Maid,” the masterpiece of English poetry in
the fifteenth century, a musical duet of love, full of the
wild charm of the great forest, with a well-accented
cadence, frequent rhymes and assonances charming the ear
as the oft repeated rustling of the forest leaves. On the
verge of capture, the poor squire is fain to choose between
a shameful death and retreat into “the grene wode.”
His betrothed, who is nothing less than a baron’s daughter,
wishes to follow him; and then, in every couplet, her
lover, in order to try her, pictures to her the terrors and
dangers of the fugitive’s life; she may perhaps see him
taken and die a robber’s death:</p>

<div class="dpoemfarlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>For
 an outlawe this is the lawe, that men hym take and binde</div>
<div class="dpp00">Wythout pytee, hanged to bee, and waver with the wynde.”</div>
</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">With this, a thrilling description of the life in the woods,
of the brambles, snow, hail, rain; no soft bed; for roof
the leaves alone:</p>

<div class="dpoemfarlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Yet

<p class="pcontinue">No delicate food, but only such as the wood affords:</p>

<p class="pcontinue">Worse even, and the trial becomes harder; the young
girl must cut off her lovely hair; life in the forest does
not allow of that ornament. Lastly, to crown all: I
have already in the forest another sweetheart, whom I
love better, and who is more beautiful. But, as resigned
as Griselda, the betrothed replies: I shall go none the
less into the forest; I will be kind to your sweetheart,
I will obey her, “for in my mynde, of all mankynde,
I love but you alone.” Then the lover’s joy breaks out:
“I wyl not too the grene wod goo, I am noo banysshyd
man,” I am not an obscure squire, but the son of the
Earl of Westmoreland, and the hour of our wedding is
now come.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn344" id="fnanc344">344</a></p>

<p>All the fugitives whom the forest received into its
depths were not romantic knights, followed by baronesses
patient as Griselda and brave as Bradamante. To pass
from poetry to real facts, they were for the greater part
formidable rovers, the same against whom Edward I
and Edward III had enacted the rigorous law for suspects<a class="afnanc" href="#fn345" id="fnanc345">345</a>
mentioned above. This caste was composed, first of the
organized bands of brigands whom the statute calls
Wastours, Roberdesmen, and Drawlatches, then of
thieves, sharpers, and malefactors of all kinds, of
outlaws of various sorts, suffering that civil death
alluded to by the lover in the “Nut Brown Maid.”</p>

<p>The sentence of outlawry was usually the starting-point
for a wandering life, which by necessity became a
life of brigandage. To be declared an
outlaw, a crime <span class="xxpn" id="p257">{257}</span>
or a misdemeanor must have been committed; a private
suit of a purely civil character was not enough;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn346" id="fnanc346">346</a>
but
to come within sight of the gallows, no great guilt was
necessary; hence the large number of outlaws. In a
criminal lawsuit of the time of Edward I<a class="afnanc" href="#fn347" id="fnanc347">347</a>
the judge
explains from his bench that the law is this: if the thief
has taken anything worth more than twelve pence, or if
he has been condemned several times for little thefts, and
the total may be worth twelve pence or more, he ought
to be hanged: “The law wills that he shall be hanged
by the neck.” Still, as the judge observes in the case of
a woman who had stolen a carpet lying on a hedge,
worth eightpence, the law is milder than in the days of
Henry III, for then a theft of the value of fourpence would
hang a man.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn348" id="fnanc348">348</a></p>

<div class="dcaption">49. FOREST LIFE—A SHOOTING CASUALTY.
<div class="fsz6">(<i>From the MS. 10 E. IV.</i>)</div>
</div></div>

<p>The man became an outlaw, and the woman a <i>weyve</i>,
that is, abandoned to the mercy of every one and unable
to claim the protection of justice. The author of “Fleta”
expresses with terrible force the condition of persons so
punished; they have wolves heads which may be cut
off with impunity: “For she is a weyve whom no one
will own, and it is equivalent to outlawry so far as penal
consequences go. An outlaw and a
weyve bear wolves <span class="xxpn" id="p258">{258}</span>
heads, which may be cut off by any one with impunity,
for deservedly ought they to perish without law who
would refuse to live according to law.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn349" id="fnanc349">349</a>
The outlaw
lost all his property and rights; all the contracts to which
he was a party fell void; he was no longer bound to any
one nor anybody bound to him. His goods were forfeit:
“the chattels of an outlaw shall belong to our lord the
king”; if he had lands the king kept the usufruct for
a year and a day, at the end of which he restored them
to the chief lord (<i>capitalis dominus</i>).<a class="afnanc" href="#fn350" id="fnanc350">350</a>
There were also
hard legal rules on this subject; a man accused of murder
and acquitted suffered confiscation nevertheless, if he
had fled, fearing justice. Listen to the magistrate:
“If a man be acquitted of manslaughter and of assent
and help, the justices shall thereupon ask the jury if the
prisoner took to flight; if they say No, let him go quits,
if Yes, the king shall have his chattels.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn351" id="fnanc351">351</a>
It may be <span class="xxpn" id="p259">{259}</span>
readily believed that the draconian severity of such regulations
was not calculated to lessen the audacity of those
whom they concerned, and that the excessive rigour of
these penalties would often transform the fugitive of a
day, who had doubted the clear-sightedness of the judge,
into a professional brigand and highway robber.</p>

<p>Besides people of this kind there were the rovers,
who, without being threatened with outlawry, had fled
the village or the farm to which they belonged. The
villein who, without special licence, left his master’s
domain, could resume his previous life and intercourse
with his kin, only by placing himself at his lord’s mercy,
or, which was less risky, after having passed a year and a
day in a free town without leaving it and without the
lord, often unaware of the place, having interrupted the
prescription. In this latter case he became a free man,
and the ties which bound him to the soil were broken.
But if he confined himself to wandering from place to
place he might be re-taken any day that he reappeared
at his own door.</p>

<p>An example of this may be seen in a characteristic
lawsuit of the time of Edward I, a report of which has
come down to us:—<i>A</i> presents a writ of imprisonment
against <i>B</i>. Heiham, counsel for <i>B</i>, says: It is not for
us to defend ourselves, <i>A</i> is our villein, his writ cannot
take effect against us. This is verified, it is found that
<i>A</i> is the son of a villein of <i>B</i>, that he ran away, and several
years afterwards returned home, “to his nest,” where he
was taken as a villein. The judge declares that this
seizure was legal; that a villein might wander about
during six, seven years or more, but if at the end he were
found “in his own nest and at his hearth,” he might be
seized as continuing to be his lord’s lawful property;
the fact of his return put him into the
condition he was <span class="xxpn" id="p260">{260}</span>
in before his departure. On hearing this decision the
delighted counsel appropriately cites the scripture, “He
fell into the pit which he hath digged.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn352" id="fnanc352">352</a></p>

<p>At that period a villein could still be sold as chattel,
given away as a present, donated to a convent for the
benefit of one’s soul: “I Hugo de Ringesdon .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. gave
and conceded .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to God and Blessed Mary and the
Abbot and convent of Sulby, for the salvation of my soul
and that of my ancestors and successors, in perpetual
frank almoigne, Robert son of Juliana de Walton, with
all his sequel and all his chattels, nothing remaining
of any bond with me or my successors for ever.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn353" id="fnanc353">353</a></p>

<p>Or again: “Be it known to all, now and hereafter,
that I John, son of Thomas [of Wurtham], have sold
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to Hugo abbot of Saint Edmunds .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Serval, son
of William of Wurtham with all his sequel .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and
all the tenement which he held from me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for sixteen
shillings of silver which the said abbot gave me.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn354" id="fnanc354">354</a></p>

<p>If the actual sale of a man, sold as such, was infrequent,
the transfer of a
tenement, tenant included, <span class="xxpn" id="p261">{261}</span>
was of constant occurrence; the man and his kin
changed hands as the plot of land to which he was bound.
The monastery of Meaux, near Beverley, having claimed,
against the abbot of St. Mary of York, the right to fish
in the Wathsand and Hornsey meres, and no satisfactory
proof being available on either side, recourse was had
by the two religious disputants to judicial duel. The
combat was severe: “It took place at York and lasted
from morning to evening, our champion,” says the Meaux
chronicler, “slowly succumbing.” Before complete defeat,
however, “the duel was interrupted by the cleverness of
a certain judge, Roger de Thurkelby, a friend of ours”;
Meaux yielded the fishing rights to York, but York
“granted us one toft, with a man holding that toft in
villeinage, and his sequel.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn355" id="fnanc355">355</a></p>

<p>The change in customs made the separate sale of
the man himself practically impossible in the fourteenth
century,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn356" id="fnanc356">356</a>
but the <i>adscriptio glebæ</i> remained imperative,
and every means was taken to prevent the villeins from
uprooting themselves and ceasing to be, like their own
trees, fixtures liable to change masters with the trees.</p>

<p>The villein’s highest desire was of course manumission
and complete independence: a dream so ambitious
that most of them scarcely dared to form it, up to the
time of the peasants’ revolt, when
it became general, <span class="xxpn" id="p262">{262}</span>
and was realized—for a day. Second to that he wanted
the commutation for a cash payment of the harassing
personal labour due by him to his lord, a change which
went on increasingly in the course of the fourteenth
century.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn357" id="fnanc357">357</a>
When neither was possible and the burden
became unbearable, he would, happen what may, try
to escape and live elsewhere unknown and masterless.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn358" id="fnanc358">358</a></p>

<p>The villein, when in this mood, had two great temptations,
the cities with their franchise, which even his
master did not dare infringe,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn359" id="fnanc359">359</a>
and the forest, where he was
out of reach. Noblemen sometimes allowed their villeins
to become merchants and go from city to city. They were
very near freedom, but not quite free; they had to pay
“chevage” to their master as a sign of subjection,
and if these serfs ceased to pay, the mere fact made them
runaways, “just like domestic <i>cerfs</i> (red deer),” says
Bracton, indulging in an, even then, antiquated pun.
They can be run after and captured like any domestic
animal.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn360" id="fnanc360">360</a>
<span class="xxpn" id="p263">{263}</span></p>

<p>Scarcely less tempting was the forest. Escaped
peasants provided the wandering class with its most
numerous recruits. In England several causes, the chief
of which was the great plague of 1349,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn361" id="fnanc361">361</a>
had in the fourteenth
century upset the relations of the working classes
with the rich, and the proportions between the rate of
wages and the cost of necessaries. Confronted with a
longing for emancipation which arose on all sides, parliament—the
House of Commons as willingly as the king—passed
stern laws for the maintenance of the <i>statu quo
ante pestem</i>. Thence came among the various sorts of
peasants, both the villeins bound to their plot of land
(“theirs” with the understanding they should perform
the customary services due to the lord), and the landless
labourers free to hire themselves out for wages, an
immense desire to move about and see other parts. In
their own hamlet, they found, nothing was to be got
but the same obligations and the same wages as before
the plague; but in such another county, they heard or
supposed, there were better pay and less exacting
masters<a class="afnanc" href="#fn362" id="fnanc362">362</a>; besides, why not mingle with the class of
free labourers? It was numerous
and increased <span class="xxpn" id="p264">{264}</span>
unceasingly, in spite of the law. All did not succeed in
concealing their past; and when the danger of being
“put into stocks” and sent back to their masters became
great, they fled again, changed county and became roamers.
Others, discontented with or without cause, only quitted
their place to become straightway homeless vagabonds
of the most dangerous kind. Thus in the precincts of
Westminster, the chapter house of the Abbey where the
Commons sat, resounded with ever new complaints against
the increasing lawlessness of peasants and labourers of
all sorts. The Commons, who, generally speaking, represented
the landowners of the country, and a trading
bourgeoisie<a class="afnanc" href="#fn363" id="fnanc363">363</a>
with somewhat aristocratic tendencies, rose
with force against the wishes for freedom of a class of
workers whom they in no way represented. They were
for the re-establishment of all the old laws and customs,
and the strict rejection of new demands. But the current
was too strong, and it swept by the laws, ever renewed
and ever inefficient.</p>

<p>The plague was still raging, Parliament could not
meet; the thinning of the ranks of the workers by death,
and the excessive wage demands, or refusals to work at
all, of the survivors, who preferred to live on alms, created
such a dangerous state of confusion that the king issued,
on his own authority and that of his council in June 1349,
an ordinance which formed the basis of the famous Statute
of Labourers of 1351<a class="afnanc" href="#fn364" id="fnanc364">364</a>
and of all
the subsequent ones. <span class="xxpn" id="p265">{265}</span>
The most striking of its dispositions aimed at an outright
conscription of labour, something like what we have
seen of late, under the pressure of necessity, on the
occasion of what has been for the world an even greater
calamity:</p>

<p>“Any man or woman, in our realm of England, of
whatever condition, either free or servile, sound in body
and under the age of sixty years, living not by merchandise
nor practising a definite craft, nor having personally
wherewith to live, nor possessing land which he would
cultivate, nor being somebody else’s servant, if he is
requested to serve in a service congruent to his status,
shall be bound to serve the one that shall thus request
him.” He is moreover forbidden to receive any wages
or compensations different from those of the twentieth
year of the King’s reign, that is those which were barely
sufficient before the plague and were entirely inadequate
now. Later in the year, a new ordinance forbade any
one to leave the desolated realm, “unless he were a merchant,
a notary or an undoubted messenger.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn365" id="fnanc365">365</a></p>

<p>The Commons could not imagine that, for mere
villeins, there might be such a thing as necessity, and
they uniformly attributed the new requests to the “malice
of servants,” who exacted both higher wages and other
terms of engagement than before. They would not
work “without taking hire that
was too outrageous.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn366" id="fnanc366">366</a>
<span class="xxpn" id="p266">{266}</span>
Formerly they hired themselves for a year; now they
wanted to remain their own masters and to hire themselves
by the day: the statute forbids them to do so.</p>

<p>Three years later the complaints are renewed;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn367" id="fnanc367">367</a>
the value of corn is very low and labourers refuse to
receive it as payment; they persist also in desiring day
hire; all these doings are condemned once more. The
quarrel continues and grows embittered. In the thirty-fourth
year of his reign Edward III threatens to have
the guilty branded on the forehead with an F, as a sign
of “fauxine” (falsehood).<a class="afnanc" href="#fn368" id="fnanc368">368</a>
In 1372, Parliament declares
that “labourers and servants flee from one county to
another, some go to the great towns and become artificers,
some into strange districts to work, on account of the
excessive wages, none remaining for certain in any place,
whereby the statute cannot be put in execution against
them.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn369" id="fnanc369">369</a></p>

<div class="fsz6">(<i>From the MS. 2 B.</i> vii. <i>Fourteenth
Century.</i>)</div><p class="fsz6 pfirst">“We haue the payne and
traveyle, rayne and wynd in the feldes.” (John Ball’s
speech in Berner’s Froissart.)</p>
</div></div>

<p>The Commons of the Good Parliament of 1376
secured the confirmation of all the previous statutes.
Prohibitions were renewed against any going out of their
“own district” (<i>pays propre</i>), whether they were villeins
proper, or “labourers and artificers and other servants.”
The economic changes that had taken place had rendered
possible, however, what was not so formerly; labourers
were wanted, and it was not rare to find landowners who
employed them in spite of the laws, even by the day,
and at other wages than those of the tariff. The parliamentary
petitions declare that “they
are so willingly <span class="xxpn" id="p269">{269}</span>
received in strange places suddenly into service, that
this reception gives example and comfort to all servants,
as soon as they are displeased with anything, to run from
master to master into strange places, as is aforesaid.”
And this would not go on, observe the Commons, if when
they offered their services in this fashion they were “taken
and put in the stocks.” True, indeed, but the landowners
who needed help, and whose crops were waiting on the
ground, were too happy to meet with “servantz corores”
(runaway), whoever they might be; and instead of taking
them “to the nearest gaol,” to pay and use them.
The labourers knew it, and their traditional masters had
to show less severity. For on some unreasonable demand
or over-strong reprimand, instead of submitting as formerly,
or venturing a protest, the workman said nothing
but, “par grande malice,” went away: “As soon as their
masters challenge them with bad service or offer to pay
them for their service according to the form of the said
statutes, they flee and run away suddenly out of their
service and out of their own district, from county to
county, from hundred to hundred, from town to town,
in strange places unknown to their said masters.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn370" id="fnanc370">370</a></p>

<p>Worse still, and inevitable, many among them, unable
or unwilling to work, took up begging or robbing
as a profession. These “wandering labourers become
mere beggars in order to lead an idle life, and betake
themselves out of their district commonly to the cities,
boroughs, and other good towns to beg, and they are
able-bodied and might wel ease
the community if they
would serve.” <span class="xxpn" id="p270">{270}</span></p>

<p>So much for the beggars;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn371" id="fnanc371">371</a>
now for the robbers:
“And the greater part of the said wandering servants
commonly become strong robbers, and their robberies
and felonies increase from one day to another on all sides,”
acting in small bands of “two, three or four together,”
and plundering “simple villages.” Energetic measures
must be taken; let it be prohibited to give alms to this
sort of people, and “let their bodies be put in the stocks
or taken to the next gaol,” to be sent afterwards to where
they belong. Edward III had already condemned to
prison, by his ordinance of 1349, those who, under colour
of charity “sub colore pietatis vel elemosine,” came to
the aid of sturdy beggars, those vagabonds who went
through the country “giving themselves to idleness and
vice, and sometimes to theft and other abominations.”
The same complaints recur in the time of Richard II.
Hardly is he on the throne than they are repeated from
year to year: 1377, 1378, 1379, revealing to us the
existence of early unions and federations of villeins and
labourers who, advised by men better informed than themselves,
“lours counseillours, meyntenours et abettours,”
defend their assumed freedom sometimes by force—“menassent
les ministres de lours seignurs de vie et de
membre”—sometimes by law, invoking written texts
and “exemplifications” whose value they have learnt,
and swear to remain “confederated” and to help each
other at all cost against their masters.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn372" id="fnanc372">372</a>
<span class="xxpn" id="p271">{271}</span></p>

<p>Statutes multiplied to no purpose; the king had to
recognize in his ordinance of 1383 that the “feitors
(idlers) and vagrants” overran the country “more abundantly
than they were formerly accustomed.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn373" id="fnanc373">373</a>
In 1388
he renewed all the orders of his predecessors, re-enacting
for rustics rules similar to those of the <i>Inscription maritime</i>
still applied to-day in France, for what concerns seafaring,
to the seaside population: any one who reached
the age of twelve without having done anything else
than “working at the plough and cart or other labor
or service of husbandry,” will have to continue in this
state his life long, “without being allowed to learn a
trade or handicraft,” and if one is found to be a party to
a contract of apprenticeship, the contract shall be void.</p>

<p>The king reminds, at the same time, the mayors,
bailiffs, stewards, and constables of their duties, and asks
them in particular to repair their stocks and keep them
always ready for wanderers to cease in them their
wanderings.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn374" id="fnanc374">374</a></p>

<p>No vain threats nor light penalties. The prisons of
those days little resembled the well-washed buildings
now to be seen in most English towns, at York for
instance, where the guilty ones are apt to find more
cleanliness and comfort than they ever knew before.
They were mostly fetid dungeons, where the damp of
the walls and the stationary position compelled by the
irons corrupted the blood and engendered hideous
maladies.</p>

<p>Many a wandering workman, accustomed to an active
life and the open air, came thus, thanks
to the incessant <span class="xxpn" id="p272">{272}</span>
ordinances of king and Parliament, to repent in the dark
for his boldness, and during days and nights all alike,
to regret his liberty, his family, and his “nest.” The
effect of such a treatment on the physical constitution
of the victims may be guessed or imagined, but without
any imagining the reports of justice show it only too
clearly. A roll of the time of Henry III reads, for instance,
as follows:</p>

<p>“Assizes held at Ludinglond. The jury present that
William le Sauvage took two men, aliens, and one woman,
and imprisoned them at Thorlestan, and detained them
in prison until one of them died in prison, and the other
lost one foot, and the woman lost either foot by putrefaction.
Afterwards he took them to the Court of the
lord the king at Ludinglond to try them by the same
Court. And when the Court saw them, it was loth to
try them, because they were not attached for any robbery
or misdeed for which they could suffer judgment. And
so they were permitted to depart.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn375" id="fnanc375">375</a></p>

<div class="dcaption">51. IN THE STOCKS.
<div class="fsz6">(<i>From the MS. 10 E. IV.</i>)</div>
</div></div>

<p>How in such a condition the poor creatures could
“depart,” and what became of them, the Assize Rolls do
not say. Certain it is that no sort of
indemnity was given <span class="xxpn" id="p273">{273}</span>
to help them out of trouble in their horrible condition.
The justice of our fathers did not stop at trifles.</p>

<p>The stocks, which according to the laws of Richard II
were always to be kept in good condition ready for use,
consisted of two beams placed one on the other. At proper
intervals round holes were cut; the upper beam was
raised, and the legs of the prisoners were passed through
the holes; sometimes there was a third beam, in the
openings of which the wrists of the wretches were also
caught; the body sometimes rested on a stool, sometimes
on the ground. In certain places the stocks were
pretty high; the sufferer’s legs were placed in them and
he remained thus, his body stretched on the ground in
the damp, his head lower than his feet; but this refinement
of cruelty was not habitual.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn376" id="fnanc376">376</a></p>

<p>Stocks are still to be seen in many places in England;
for instance, in the picturesque village of Abinger, where
they stand on the green, near the churchyard. Others
in a very good state of preservation are in existence at
Shalford, near Guildford. They have not long ceased
to be used in England; vagabonds and drunkards were
seen in them within the memory of men who were not
old when the present book was written. According to
their remembrance people when released felt so benumbed
that they were scarcely able to stand, and experienced
great difficulty in getting away.</p>

</div></div>

<p>But the threat of prisons so unhealthy and of stocks
so unpleasant did not hold back the labourers more and
more weary of being tied to the soil. Every pretext for
leaving their place was welcome; they even dared to
use that of a devotional journey. They set out, staff in
hand, “under colour of going far on
a pilgrimage,” and <span class="xxpn" id="p274">{274}</span>
never returned. But a new restraint was to be applied
to tame this turbulent spirit, the obligation for every
one to furnish himself with a kind of letter of travel or
passport, in order to move from one county to another.
None might leave his village if he did not carry a “letter
patent stating the cause of his going and the date of his
return, if he were to return.” In other words, even with
the right to go and settle definitively elsewhere, a permit
for moving had to be procured. These letters would
be sealed by a “good man” (<i>prod homme</i>), assigned in
each hundred, city, or borough, by the justices of the
peace, and special seals were to be expressly made,
said the statute, bearing the king’s arms in the centre,
the name of the county around, and that of the hundred,
city, or borough across. Even the case of fabricating
false letters was foreseen, which shows how well was
realized the ardent desire of many men of
this class to <span class="xxpn" id="p275">{275}</span>
leave the place where they were tied. Every individual
surprised without regular papers would be sent to jail.</p>

<div class="fsz6">(<i>From the MS. 10 E. IV.</i>)</div>
</div></div>

<p>Beggars were treated as “servants” who had no
“testimonial letters.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn377"
id="fnanc377">377</a> What was wanted was to impose
immobility upon as many people as possible, and thus
hinder the disquieting peregrinations of so many rovers.
As for beggars incapable of work, they must nevertheless
cease frequenting the highroads, and must end their days
in the cities where they chance to be at the time of the
proclamation, or at most in some town near the spot where
they were born; they shall be taken there within forty
days, to stay “for the rest of their lives.”</p>

<p>What is stranger, and lacking other proofs, would
show to what class students then belonged, is that they
are included in the same category; they were accustomed,
on returning to their homes, or on making pilgrimages,
or going to the university, to hold out a hand for the
charity of passers-by and to knock at the door of possible
givers. They were ranked with the beggars, and put
in irons if they lacked the regulation letter; this document
was to be given them by the
Chancellor, and that <span class="xxpn" id="p276">{276}</span>
was the only difference: “And that the scholars of the
universities that go so begging have letters testimonial
of their Chancellor upon the same pain.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn378" id="fnanc378">378</a></p>

<p>Again, in the following year (1389), a new statute
reproves the custom of “artificers, labourers, servants,”
etc., who keep for their own use harriers and other dogs,
and on “feast days, when good Christians are at church
hearing Divine service,” get into the parks and warrens
of the nobility and destroy the game. Much more,
they avail themselves of these occasions when they meet
together armed, without fear of being disturbed, to “hold
their assemblies, conversations, and conspiracies, to rise
against and disobey their allegience.” The thickets of
the seignorial forests must have sheltered many a meeting
of this kind during church services on the eve of the great
revolt of 1381;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn379" id="fnanc379">379</a>
in such retreats no doubt were brought
forth some of the living and stirring ideas which, transported
from place to place by the wanderers, made the
people of different counties understand that they were
the same people, suffering from a variety of abuses,
longing for relief.</p>

<p>In a revolt like this, the part played by the
wandering class is considerable, and the historian should
not neglect it. If we do not take this element into account,
it is hard to explain the extent and importance of a
movement which came near having consequences comparable
to those of the French Revolution. “I had lost
my heritage and the kingdom of England,”
said Richard II <span class="xxpn" id="p277">{277}</span>
on the evening of the day when his presence of mind
had saved him, and he was right. Why was the French
Jacquerie a commonplace, powerless rising compared to
the English revolt? The reasons are manifold, but
one of the chief was the absence of a class of wayfarers
as strong, active, and numerous as that of England. This
class served to unite all the people: by its means those
of the South learnt the ideas of those of the North, what
each suffered and desired; the sufferings and wishes
were not always identical, but it was enough to know
that all had reforms to demand. Thus, when the news
came that the revolt had begun, the people rose on all
sides, and while it was apparent that the desires of each
were not absolutely similar, yet the basis of the contention
being the same, and all wishing for more independence,
they went forth together without being otherwise acquainted
than by the intermediary of the wayfarers. The
kings of England, indeed, had perceived the danger,
and on different occasions had promulgated statutes
bearing especially on the talk indulged in by these
wanderers about the nobles, prelates, judges, and all
the depositaries of public power. Edward I had said
in one of his laws:</p>

<p>“Forasmuch as there have been oftentimes found in
the country devisors of tales, whereby discord, or occasion
of discord, hath many times arisen between the king and
his people, or great men of this realm; for the damage
that hath and may thereof ensue, it is commanded, that
from henceforth none be so hardy to tell or publish any
false news or tales, whereby discord, or occasion of discord,
or slander may grow between the king and his
people, or the great men of the realm; and he that doth
so, shall be taken and kept in prison, until he hath brought
him into the court who was the first author of the tale.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn380" id="fnanc380">380</a></p>

<p>The danger of such speeches, which
touched the acts <span class="xxpn" id="p278">{278}</span>
and even the thoughts of the great men of the kingdom,
became menacing anew under Richard II, and in the
first years of his reign the following statute was enacted,
reinforcing that of 1275:</p>

<p>“Item, Of devisors of false news and reporters
of horrible and false lyes, concerning prelates, dukes,
earls, barons, and other nobles and great men of the realm,
and also concerning the chancellor, treasurer, clerk of
the privy seal, steward of the king’s house, justices of
the one bench or of the other, and of other great officers
of the realm about things which by the said prelates, lords,
nobles, and officers aforesaid were never spoken, done,
nor thought .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. whereby debates and discords might
arise betwixt the said lords or between the Lords and
the Commons, which God forbid, and whereof great
peril and mischief might come to all the realm, and quick
subversion and destruction of the said realm, if due remedy
be not provided: it is straitly defended upon grievous
pain, for to eschew the said damages and perils, that from
henceforth none be so hardy to devise, speak, or to tell
any false news, lyes, or other such false things, of prelates,
lords, and of other aforesaid, whereof discord or
any slander might rise within the same realm; and he
that doth the same shall incur and have the pain another
time ordained thereof by the statute of Westminster the
first.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn381" id="fnanc381">381</a>
In vain: two years later broke out the revolt
of the peasants, and the depositions of the rebels when
brought before the judge leave no doubt as to the part
played by wayfarers in the carrying of political news
from one county to another.</p>

<p>The mason John Cole, of Lose, in the parish of Maidstone,
Kent, turns informer, betrays twenty-seven of his
companions, giving their names (some proved innocent),
and saving his own head. Their plan was to make the
otherwise unpopular John of Gaunt,
king of England, <span class="xxpn" id="p279">{279}</span>
on the mere report that he had freed his “natives.” The
rebels had decided to send to him in order to ascertain,
and if the news proved true, to depose his nephew young
Richard II. The report had been brought to the city
of Canterbury by pilgrims, <i>peregrini</i>, arriving from the
North, obviously to worship at the shrine of St. Thomas.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn382" id="fnanc382">382</a></p>

<p>In mediæval France during the endless wars, and
the brief intervals between them, the roads were held by
plundering brigands: labourers or knights by birth.
Soldiers, the dregs of the lowest or highest classes, considered
the rest of society as their devoted prey, the highway
resounded with the noise of arms, the peasant fled.
Troops originally equipped for the defence of the land
attacked without scruple all whom they thought less
strong than themselves and worth robbing. Such people
“turned French,” as Froissart puts it, and “turned
English” according to the interest of the moment.</p>

<p>The vagrants threatened with the stocks by the English
law were of another kind, and whatever the number of
brigands among them these were not the majority; the
peasants mostly sympathized with, instead of fearing,
them. Thus the English revolt was not a desperate
enterprise; it was conducted with extraordinary coolness
and practical sense. The insurgents
showed a calm <span class="xxpn" id="p280">{280}</span>
consciousness of their strength which strikes us, and
struck much more the anxious knights in London; they
went with their eyes open, and, if they destroyed much,
they wished also to reform. It was possible to treat
and come to an understanding with them; truth to say,
the word and pledge given them will be broken, and the
prison, the rope and the block will quickly put an end to
the revolt; but whatever the Lords and Commons sitting
at Westminster may say,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn383" id="fnanc383">383</a>
the new bonds will not have
the tenacity of the old ones, and a great step towards
freedom, one with which the continent has nothing comparable,
will have been made.</p>

<p>In France, the beast of burden, ill-nourished, ill-treated,
fretted by the harness, trudged wearily along
with shaking head, wan eye and a halting gait; his
sudden bolts only caused new loads to be added to his
fardel, and that was all; centuries were to pass before
the day of accounting came and, in blood too, the account
would be settled.</p>

<h3 class="h3chap">CHAPTER I
<span class="hbig">
WANDERING PREACHERS AND FRIARS</span></h3>

<p class="pfirst">While the inward consciousness of common
wants and longings for better days spread
everywhere, by means of that crowd of work-people
whom we find in England ceaselessly on the move
in spite of statutes, the guiding ideas were sown broadcast
by another kind of roamer, the preachers. Sprung
also from the people, they had studied; as we have seen
it was not necessary to be rich in order to go through
the course at Oxford; the villeins even sent their children
there, and the Commons, of scant liberalism as we know,
protested against this emancipation of another kind, this
advancement by means of learning, “avancement par
clergie.” Preventive measures, they thought, were indispensable
to save “the honour” of the freemen of the
realm, by which they meant privilege; ideas of honour
have changed. But, even then, it was going too far,
and the king, who had after all learnt a lesson in 1381,
rebuked the Commons with a “le
roi s’avisera” which <span class="xxpn" id="p284">{284}</span>
was then, and is to-day, the form of royal refusal.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn384" id="fnanc384">384</a>
These
clerks knew what was the condition of the people; they
knew the miseries of the poor, which were those of their
father and mother and of themselves; the intellectual
culture they had received enabled them to transform
into precise conceptions the general aspirations of the
tillers of the soil. The former are not less necessary
than the latter to every important social movement; if
both are indispensable to the making of the tool, handle
and blade, it is these definite views which form the blade.</p>

<p>The roaming preachers knew how to sharpen it, and
they were numerous. Those whom Wyclif sent to
popularize his doctrines,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn385" id="fnanc385">385</a>
his “simple priests,” or “poor
priests,” did just what others had done before them;
they imitated their forerunners, and no more confined
themselves to expounding the difficult and not always
democratic theories of their master than the mendicant
friars, or monks, or secular priests, friends of the revolution,
strictly kept to the precepts of the gospel. Their
sympathies were with the people, and they showed it in
their discourses. Wyclif contributed to the increase
of these wanderers; his people came from the same
stock as the others; if it was easy for him to find clerks
ready to act as his missionaries, the reason was that many
in the kingdom were already prepared for such a task,
and only awaited their
opportunity.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn386" id="fnanc386">386</a>
The revolutionary <span class="xxpn" id="p285">{285}</span>
leader John Ball was a secular priest, and so was the well-known
Lollard, William Thorpe.</p>

<p>All, in fact, did the same kind of work. For different
motives and with different aims, they led to the same
results: the belief that the State, the Church, the Government,
the Court, the rule of the masters, whether spiritual
or temporal, were not what they should be, and that a
change <i>must</i> come. Doubts and discontents always help
each other; whoever strikes at the tree shakes the tree.
Wyclif’s theory, “both before and after the rising, was
that temporal lords had a right to their property, but that
churchmen had no right to theirs.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn387" id="fnanc387">387</a>
His teachings
helped, however, to spread doubts as to the legitimacy
of both. Though it had nothing to do with Lollard
tenets, the diffusion thereof was facilitated by the papal
schism of 1378: another great tree that was shaken.</p>

<p>Men able to address a crowd scoured the country, drawing
together the poor and attracting them by harangues filled
with what people who suffer always like to hear. The
statute passed just after the revolt clearly shows how much
the influence of the wandering preachers was feared.
Their dress even and manner of speech are described;
these malcontents have an austere aspect, they go “from
county to county, and from town to town in certain habits
under dissimulation of great holiness.” They dispense
of course with the ecclesiastical papers which regular
preachers ought to carry; they are “without the licence
of our Holy Father the Pope, or of the
Ordinaries of the <span class="xxpn" id="p286">{286}</span>
places, or other sufficient authority.” They make themselves
heard, and their successors to this day have never
ceased to follow suit, “not only in churches and churchyards,
but also in markets, fairs, and other open places
where a great congregation of people is.” Their real
subject is not dogma, but the social question; on their
lips the religious sermon becomes a political harangue.
“Which persons,” the statute says, “do also preach
divers matters of slander, to engender discord and dissension
betwixt divers estates of the said realm as well
spiritual as temporal, in exciting of the people, to the
great peril of all the realm.” They are cited to appear
before the ecclesiastic authority, the ordinaries, but refuse
to “obey to their summons and commandments.” Let
the sheriffs and others of the king’s officers henceforth
watch with care these wandering orators and send to prison
those unable to show proper certificates.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn388" id="fnanc388">388</a></p>

<p>We may gain an idea of their speeches by recalling
the celebrated harangue of the priest John Ball,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn389" id="fnanc389">389</a>
the
most stirring of these travelling orators. Certainly, in
the Latin phrase of the “Chronicle of England,” his
thoughts are given too solemn and too correct a form,
but all that we know of the circumstances matches so
well his undoubted purports, that his actual speech cannot
have differed, in its trend at least, from what the chronicler
has transmitted to us. The popular saying quoted before
serves as his text, and he developes it in this manner:</p>

<p>“At the beginning we were all created equal; it is
the tyranny of perverse men which has caused servitude
to arise, in spite of God’s law; if God had willed that
there should be serfs He would have said
at the beginning <span class="xxpn" id="p289">{289}</span>
of the world who should be serf and who should be
lord.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn390" id="fnanc390">390</a></p>

<div class="dctr01" id="fig55">
<img src="images/i284.jpg" width="800" height="490" alt="" />
<div class="dcaption">55. “WHEN ADAM DELVED AND EVE SPAN.”
<div class="fsz6">(<i>The motto of John Ball’s speech illustrated from the MS.
2 B.</i> vii. <i>Fourteenth Century</i>).</div>
</div></div>

<p>What made Ball powerful was that he found his best
weapons in the Bible; quoting it he appealed to the
good sentiments of the lowly, to their virtue, their reason;
he showed that the Divine Word accorded with their
interest; they would be “like the good father of a family
who cultivates his field and plucks up the weeds.” The
same ideas are attributed to him by almost all the chroniclers.
Froissart uses to describe his doings almost the
same words as the statute already quoted. He represents
him when he found a congregation of people, especially
on Sundays, after mass, preaching in the open air sermons
similar to that in the “Chronicon Angliæ”: “This
preest,” says Froissart, “used often tymes on the sondayes
after masse, whanne the people were goynge out of the
mynster, to go into the cloyster and preche, and made
the people to assemble about hym, and wolde say thus:
A ye good people, the maters gothe nat well to passe in
Englande, nor shall nat do tyll every thyng be common,
and that there be no villayns nor gentylmen. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What
have we deserved or why shulde we be kept thus in
servage? we be all come fro one father and one mother,
Adam and Eve: whereby can they say or shewe that
they be gretter lordes than we be, savynge by that they
cause us to wyn and labour for that they dispende .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
They dwell in fayre houses, and we have the payne and
traveyle, rayne and wynde in the feldes; and by that
that cometh of our labours they kepe and maynteyne
their estates. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Lette us go to the kyng, he is yonge,
and shewn hym what servage we be in. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Thus Johan
sayd on sondayes whan the people issued out of the
churches in the vyllages .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and so they wolde murmure
one with another in the feldes and in
the wayes as <span class="xxpn" id="p290">{290}</span>
they went togyder, affermyng howe Johan Ball sayd
trouthe.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn391" id="fnanc391">391</a></p>

<p>So the enthusiastic multitude promised to make him
archbishop and chancellor of that kingdom in which he
dreamed there should be “equal liberty, equal rank,
equal power” for all; but he was taken, drawn, hanged,
beheaded, and quartered,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn392" id="fnanc392">392</a>
and his dream remained a dream.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, politics apart, there might yet be found
in the fourteenth century some of God’s elect who,
alarmed by the crimes of the world and the state of sin
in which men lived, left their cells or the paternal roof
to go about among villages and towns and preach conversion.
There remained some, but they were rare.
Contrary to others, these did not speak of public affairs,
but of eternal interests; they had not always received
sacred orders; they acted as volunteers to the celestial
army. Of this sort was the before mentioned Richard
Rolle, of Hampole, whose life was partly that of a hermit,
partly of a wandering preacher. He was neither monk,
nor doctor, nor priest; when young, he had abandoned
his father’s house to go and lead a contemplative life in
solitude. There he meditated, prayed, and mortified
himself; crowds came to his cell to listen to his exhortations;
he had ecstatic trances; his friends took off
his ragged cloak, mended it, and put it back on his shoulders
without his perceiving it. He later left his retreat, and
for a long time travelled over the north of England,
becoming a wanderer, “changing place continually,”
preaching to lead men to salvation. He finally settled
at Hampole, where he ended his life in seclusion, writing
incessantly, and edifying the neighbourhood by his devotion;
he died the year of the great plague, 1349. Scarcely
was he dead than his tomb attracted pilgrims, pious people
brought offerings there, miracles were
performed. In the <span class="xxpn" id="p291">{291}</span>
nuns’ convent at Hampole, which drew from the vicinity
of his tomb great honour and profit, an “Office of St.
Richard, the hermit,” was composed, as we have seen,
to be sung when he should be canonized. But the office
of the old hermit and itinerant preacher has never had
occasion to be sung down to the present day.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn393" id="fnanc393">393</a></p>

<p>The wandering preachers met with in the villages
were not always Lollards sent by Wyclif, nor inspired
men who, like Rolle of Hampole, held their mission
from their conscience and from God; they were often
members of an immense and powerful caste sub-divided
into several orders, that of the mendicant friars. The
two principal branches were the Dominicans, Preachers, or
Black friars, and the Franciscans, Friars minor or Grey
friars, both established in England in the thirteenth century,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn394" id="fnanc394">394</a>
the “men of this [world] that most wide walken,”
said Langland.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn395" id="fnanc395">395</a></p>

<p>The immortal satires of Chaucer should not blind
us to the initial merit of these orders, nor cause us
to see in the members thereof, at all times, nothing
but impudent and idle vagabonds, at once impious,
superstitious, and greedy—</p>

<div class="dcaption">56. A WORLDLY ECCLESIASTIC.
<div class="fsz6">(<i>From the MS. 10 E. IV.</i>)</div>
</div></div>

<p>In Chaucer’s days, such friars were many, but some
better ones could also be met; not only those, rare indeed
in the fourteenth century, who continued the traditions
of their founder, living among the poor, poor as they,
and withal wise, devout, and compassionate: Chaucer’s
friar was of a different sort; he avoided acquaintance
with “a lazer or a beggere,” unwilling to deal “with
such poraile.” But even among those who lived careless
of the rule, some were at work
whose thoughts, dangerous <span class="xxpn" id="p293">{293}</span>
as they might be, were not so base, those friars namely
who, when the moment came, could be confounded with
the simple priests of their enemy Wyclif, and who were
certainly comprised along with them in the statute of
1382. Certain it is that many friars, in their roaming
career, preached in the market place, just like John Ball,
the new doctrines of emancipation. Hence they alone
among the clergy, at the hour of the great revolt, still
preserved a certain popularity among the lowly; and the
monastic chroniclers, their natural enemies, complacently
paraded in their narratives this new grievance against these
detested orders.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn397" id="fnanc397">397</a>
Langland, who cursed the revolt, cursed
also the friars for having a share of responsibility in it.
Envy has whispered into their ears and said: study logic,
law, and the hollow dreams of philosophers, and go from
village to village proving that all property ought to be
in common—the very teaching of John Ball:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpp09">“and proven hit by Seneca</div>
<div class="dpp00">That alle thyng under hevene · ouhte to beo in comune.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn398" id="fnanc398">398</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>Always armed with good sense, Langland plainly
declares that the author of these subversive theories lies;
the Bible says, “Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s
goods.” Formerly the life of the friars was exemplary,
Charity dwelt among them; this was in the days of
the great saint of Assisi, the friend of men, the friend of
birds, the friend of all that had been created and could
suffer.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn399" id="fnanc399">399</a>
<span class="xxpn" id="p294">{294}</span></p>

<p>And, indeed, what a holy mission their founder had
given them! Coarsely dressed, barefoot, getting only
such food as was freely offered them, they were to go
into the towns and visit the poorest, most densely populated
and unhealthiest suburbs, to seek out the lost.</p>

<p>“And all the brothers,” said Francis, in his rule,
“are to be clad in mean habits, and may blessedly mend
them with sacks and other pieces; whom I admonish
and exhort, that they do not despise or censure such men
as they see clad in curious and gay garments and using
delicate meats and drinks, but rather let every one judge
and despise himself.” They must never quarrel, but be
“meek, peacable, modest, mild and humble. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And
they are not to ride unless some manifest necessity or
infirmity oblige them. Whatsoever house they go into,
they shall first say, ‘Peace be unto this house,’ and, according
to the Gospel, it shall be lawful for them to eat of all
meats that are set before them.” They must beg in
order to get the necessaries of life, but they must receive
them in kind, never in money. “The brothers shall not
make anything their own, neither house nor place, nor
any other thing; and they shall go confidently to beg
alms like pilgrims and strangers in this world, serving
our Lord in poverty and humility.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn400" id="fnanc400">400</a></p>

<p>All the miseries, all the hideous blemishes of humanity,
every kind of outcasts, the physical or moral lepers, were
to have their sympathy; and the lower classes in return
would love and venerate them, and grow morally better,
owing to their word and example. Eccleston relates that a
friar minor once put on his sandals without permission to
go to matins. He dreamt afterwards that he was arrested
by robbers, who cried out, “Kill him! Kill him!”</p>

<p>“But I am a friar minor,” said he, sure of being
respected. <span class="xxpn" id="p295">{295}</span></p>

<p>“Thou liest, for thou art not barefoot.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn401" id="fnanc401">401</a></p>

<p>The first of their duties was to remain poor, in order
to be able, having nothing to lose, fearlessly to use firm
language to the rich and powerful of the world. When
on his death-bed, in 1253, wise and courageous Robert
Grosseteste, Bishop of Lincoln, a great friend of theirs,
and because a friend of theirs, reminded them of their
rule, appropriately quoting a line of Juvenal’s:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpp00">“Cantabit vacuus coram latrone viator.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>The friars were to be like the traveller without money,
whose peace of mind is never disturbed by meeting
robbers.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn402" id="fnanc402">402</a></p>

<p>St. Francis had not wished his friars to be men of
learning and study; he was afraid especially of those
subtle theological and metaphysical researches which uselessly
absorbed the life of so many great clerics. Others
enough, he thought, would devote themselves to such
speculations; he wanted to fill a gap and in this line
there was no gap. His rule was so strict that the famous
Roger Bacon, who belonged to his order, had to apply
to the pope to be permitted to use ink and parchment.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn403" id="fnanc403">403</a>
What the saint desired was to send throughout the world
an army of missionaries who would devote themselves
materially and morally to the welfare, body and soul, of
all the weary, the derelict, the dregs of humanity. Thus
practised, with no room left for the pride of knowledge,
disinterestedness was the more
absolute, servitude the <span class="xxpn" id="p296">{296}</span>
more voluntary, and the effect on the masses the greater.
The subtlety of teachers was not necessary for the fulfilling
of this task; and the striking example of the
poverty of the consoler, heedless of his own troubles, was the
best of consolations. Above all, the vanity of the apostle
must be killed, the greatness of his merit must be apparent
to God only. With a heart so purified he would necessarily
have a sufficient comprehension of the problems
of life and of the high moral aims accessible even to
the lowest to be naturally eloquent; the study of the
“Summæ,” in repute, was useless.</p>

<p>But too many dangers surrounded the sublime foundation,
and the first was knowledge itself. “The Emperor
Charles, Roland and Oliver,” once said the Saint, “and
all the paladins and all strong men, have pursued the
infidel in battle till death, and with great pains and
labour have won their memorable victories. The holy
martyrs died struggling for the faith of Christ. But in
our days there are people who seek glory and honour
among men simply by the narration of the deeds of heroes.
In like manner there are some among you who take more
pleasure in writing and preaching on the merits of the
saints than in imitating their works.” This reply St.
Francis made to a novice who wished to have a psalter.
He humorously added, “When you have a psalter you
will wish to have a breviary, and when you have a breviary
you will sit in a chair like a great prelate, and will say to
your brother, ‘Brother, fetch me my breviary.’”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn404" id="fnanc404">404</a></p>

<p>The popularity of the friars had soon
become immense,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn405" id="fnanc405">405</a>
<span class="xxpn" id="p297">{297}</span>
and it was found that they had monopolized in England
everything that concerned religion.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn406" id="fnanc406">406</a>
By a quite human
contradiction—let Brutus be Cæsar—their poverty had
invited riches, and their self-denial power; the hovels
where they lodged at first had become sumptuous monasteries
with chapels as large as cathedrals; the rich wanted
to be buried there, in tombs chiselled with the latest refinements
of the florid Gothic. Their apologists of the
fifteenth century relate with admiration that in their fine
library at London, for in spite of the rule they had a fine
library, there was a tomb adorned with four cherubims;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn407" id="fnanc407">407</a>
that their church, begun in 1306, was three hundred
feet long, ninety-five wide, and sixty-four feet high, with
the columns all of marble as well as the pavement. Kings
and princes had enriched the building; some had given
the altars, others the stalls; Edward III, “for the repose
of the soul of the most illustrious Queen Isabella, buried
in the choir” (who had ended her immoral life in the
habit of the Santa Clara nuns), repaired the great middle
window, blown down by the wind. In the same church
was preserved the heart of Queen Eleanor, mother of
Edward I. Relating that it was there, Rishanger, a
monk of Saint Albans and a contemporary, made thereupon
a remark, which Walsingham, also a monk
of St. Albans, gleefully reproduced in his “Historia
Anglicana”: “Her body was buried in the monastery
of Ambresbury, but her heart in London, in the church
of the Minorites, who, like all friars of every order, claim
for themselves something of the bodies of any powerful
persons dying; after the manner of
the dogs assembling <span class="xxpn" id="p298">{298}</span>
round corpses, where each one greedily awaits his portion
to devour.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn408" id="fnanc408">408</a>
Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, had
given for the same building twenty trees from his forest
of Tunbridge. Rich merchants, the mayor, the aldermen,
followed suit. The names of the donors were inscribed
on the windows, and Langland was indignant, and recalled
the precept, “Let not thy left hand know what thy right
hand doeth.” We learn thus that the third window on
the west had been given by Walter Mordon, “stoke-fyschmonger,”
and Mayor of London. The second
window on the south was due to John of Charlton, knight,
and his wife, whose arms figured in it; the fourth to
Walter de Gorst, fellmonger of London; the fifth to the
Earl of Lancaster; the fourth on the west to “various
collections, and thus it does not bear a name.” One of
the donors is styled the special father and friend of the
friars minor.</p>

<p>It could be but a delight for the Wyclifites to reproach
the friars with all these mundane splendours; Wyclif
revels in it:</p>

<p>“Freris bylden mony grete chirchis and costily waste
housis, and cloystris as hit were castels, and that withoute
nede. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Grete housis make not men holy, and
onely by holynesse is God wel served.” Those convents
are “Caymes Castelis.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn409" id="fnanc409">409</a></p>

<div class="fsz6">(<i>From the MS. Domit. A.</i> xvii. <i>in the
British Museum</i>.)</div>
</div></div>

<p>Interminable lists, too, of cardinals, bishops, and
kings who have belonged to the order are drawn up, not
forgetting even “certain persons of importance in the
world,”—the very antithesis of their founder’s intent.
Finally, they enumerate the dead who at the last moment
assumed the habit of the friars:
“Brother Sir Roger <span class="xxpn" id="p301">{301}</span>
Bourne, knight, buried at Norwich in the friars’ habit,
1334.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn410" id="fnanc410">410</a></p>

<p>The pride and riches of the Dominicans are just as
great. The author of “Pierce the Ploughman’s Crede,”
towards the end of the fourteenth century, accurately
describes one of their monasteries, the splendid columns
to be seen there, the sculptures, paintings, and gildings
that adorn the chapter house, so beautiful that it obviously
reminds the author of the one at Westminster, or of the
painted chamber, “la chambre peinte,” where at times
Parliament sat:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpp00">“As a Parlement-hous · y-peynted aboute,”</div>
</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">the magnificent stained glass windows ornamented with
the arms of the nobles or the mark of the merchants who
have given them (“merkes of marchauntes”), and “lovely
ladies,” their bronze figures lying on the slabs, “in many
gay garmentes,” the imposing tombs of knights heightened
with gold.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn411" id="fnanc411">411</a></p>

<p>The proportions are reversed; as great as the modesty
required by the holy founder was now the pride. The
faults Chaucer reproaches them with creep in among them;
they become interested, greedy, coarse men of the world.
The necessity for them to live among the laity had been
one of their chief dangers; they were to save the laity,
but were instead corrupted by it; they caught the plague
that they were to cure. Before even the
middle of the <span class="xxpn" id="p302">{302}</span>
thirteenth century, one of them had had a revelation that
“Demons celebrated every year a council against the order,
and had found three means (to pervert it), that is, intercourse
with women, the receiving of useless persons, and
the handling of money.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn412" id="fnanc412">412</a></p>

<p>Mendicity is now their trade, which some practice
well, others better; miracles of self-denial were demanded
of them, and behold, on the contrary, prodigies of selfishness.
It is no longer religion, it is their order which
must be promoted; they preach not on behalf of Christ,
but on behalf of their convent; the reversal is complete.
All borrow largely from the treasure of good works
amassed by their first apostles and spend it madly. The
respect of the multitude lessens, their renown for holiness
declines; they cast into the other scale of the balance so
many faults and disorders that it overweighs. And what
remains henceforth? Superstition replaces devotion;
some, in spite of the rule, have studied metaphysics and
sciences, the <i>trivium</i>, the <i>quadrivium</i><a class="afnanc" href="#fn413" id="fnanc413">413</a>; for a larger number,
however, it is not learning but a gross materialism that
veils the superhuman ideal of Francis of Assisi. Contact
with their habit is equivalent to a good deed; if the dress
is assumed on the death-bed the demons will take flight.
Numberless visions have revealed to them these articles
of a new faith: “Thei techen lordis and namely ladies,”
says Wyclif, “that if they dyen in Fraunceys habite, thei
schul nevere cum in helle for vertu thereof.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn414" id="fnanc414">414</a>
<span class="xxpn" id="p303">{303}</span></p>

<p>And so it came to pass that, not only poets like
Chaucer and Langland, not only reformers like Wyclif,
but also the universities<a class="afnanc" href="#fn415" id="fnanc415">415</a>
and the monks of the old-established
orders, waged open war against the friars.
To which the monks were moved partly, it is true, by
jealousy, when they saw these newly created brotherhoods
rising in importance, in numbers and in wealth, but partly,
also, by the sight of undeniable abuses and worldliness.
In such an authoritative work as the “English History,”
written in St. Albans Abbey by Chaucer’s contemporary,
Thomas Walsingham, the present state and behaviour of
the friars is thus described: “The friars, unmindful of
their profession, have even forgotten to what end their
orders were instituted; for the holy men their law-givers
desired them to be poor and free of all kind of temporal
possessions, that they should not have anything which
they might fear to lose on account of saying the truth.
But now they are envious of possessors, approve the
crimes of the great, induce the commonalty into error,
and praise the sins of both; and with the intent of acquiring
possessions, they who had renounced possessions,
with the intent of gathering money, they who had sworn
to persevere in poverty, call good evil and evil good,
leading astray princes by adulation, the people by lies,
and drawing both with themselves out
of the straight <span class="xxpn" id="p304">{304}</span>
path.” Walsingham adds that a familiar proverb in his
time was, “He is a friar, therefore a liar.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn416" id="fnanc416">416</a></p>

<div class="dcaption">58. SPRINKLING DINERS WITH HOLY WATER.
<div class="fsz6">(<i>From the MS. 10 E. IV.</i>)</div>
</div></div>

<p>The sanctity of the institution and the unworthiness
of many of its members caused it to be at once venerated
and detested; however contemptible be the man, what
if, after all, the keys of heaven were in his hand? Respect
mingled with fear in the feeling for him. Thus poets
laughed at the friars, popular story-tellers scouted them;
distrust, doubt, contempt spread, extending from the
lowly friar to the reverend bishop himself; churchmen
were caricatured on the very stalls upon which they sat;
Master Reynard was represented delivering a sermon
while wearing episcopal insignia, and neither the miniaturist,
charged with illuminating an imposing volume of
Decretals, nor those who had entrusted him with the
work, found anything improper in his satirising on the
margin the whole ecclesiastical hierarchy, from bishops to
monks or clerks. One of the latter is shown forgetting
in the kitchen his sprinkler and bucket
of holy water; <span class="xxpn" id="p305">{305}</span>
then remembering what he has come for and going to
sprinkle the masters at table, then returning to the kitchen
maid.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn417" id="fnanc417">417</a>
In the same ironical spirit the author of a popular
song of the fourteenth century wrote:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Preste

<div class="dpp00">Somme to riote and ribaudery;</div>
<div class="dpp00">Bot ffrers gyven ham to grete study,</div>
<div class="dpp01">And to grete prayers.”</div>
</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">Several stanzas follow which
cannot be quoted.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn418"
id="fnanc418">418</a></p>

<p>The people, therefore, fitfully saw in the friars their
protectors and allies in case of revolt, while at other times
they pursued them in the streets with stones, struck them
and lacerated their garments: angels or else devils?
they were not sure. “At the same time the preaching
friars took to flight because they feared to be maltreated
and ruined, because the commonalty bore with them very
reluctantly, on account of their proud behaviour, for they
did not behave as friars ought.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn419" id="fnanc419">419</a></p>

<p>“Know ye,” says the king, “that we have understood,
that some persons of our kingdom of England, by the
instigation of the evil spirit, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. do and daily strive to
do harm and scandal to our beloved in Christ, the religious
men, friars of the order of minors, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. openly and secretly
stirring up our people against them to destroy the houses
of the said friars, tearing their habits from them, striking
some, and ill-treating them, against our peace.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn420" id="fnanc420">420</a></p>

<p>From another point of view, that of
public safety, the <span class="xxpn" id="p306">{306}</span>
Commons were indignant at the number of foreigners
among the friars, whom they considered a permanent
danger to the State. They requested “that all the alien
friars, of whatever habit they might be, should void the
realm before the Feast of St. Michael, and if they remained
beyond the said feast they should be held as out of the
common law,” that is, outlawed.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn421" id="fnanc421">421</a></p>

<p>The friars kept their assurance, they were blessed in
the days of their good deeds; now they speak loud
and make themselves feared; to the Pope alone they are
amenable; they carry their heads high, their power is
independent, they have become a church within the Church.
Along with the priest who preaches and confesses in his
parish is to be seen the wandering friar, who preaches
and confesses everywhere; his universal presence and
power are sources of conflict; the parish priest finds
himself abandoned; the religious wayfarer brings the
unknown, the extraordinary, and everybody runs to him.
He lays down his staff and wallet and begins to talk;
his language is that of the people, the whole parish is
present; he busies himself with their eternal welfare,
and also with their earthly interests, for lay life is familiar
to him, and he can give appropriate advice. But his
teaching is sometimes suspicious. “These false prophets,”
says not Wyclif, but the Council of Saltzburg in 1386,
“by their sermons full of fables often lead astray the
souls of their hearers”; they make game of the authority
of the parish priests.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn422" id="fnanc422">422</a></p>

<p>To stop their progress proved impossible. The tide
rose and swept away the embankments; the excellent
had become the worst, <i>corruptio optimi pessima</i>, and the
old adage was verified to the letter. In spite of grievances,
protests, derisive songs and stories, they were met everywhere,
in the hut and in the castle, begging
from the rich <span class="xxpn" id="p307">{307}</span>
and knocking also at the door of the poor. They sat
at the board of the noble, who treated them with consideration;
with him they played the part of the fashionable
man of religion; they interested, they pleased.
Wyclif shows them creeping into familiarity with the
great, liking “to speke bifore lordis and sitte at tho mete
with hom, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. also to be confessoures of lordis and
ladyes.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn423" id="fnanc423">423</a>
Langland, in “Piers Plowman,” is equally
severe on “frere Flaterere.” In a Wyclifite treatise of
the same period we read, “Thei geten hem worldly offis
in lordis courtis, and summe to ben conseilours and reuleris
of werris, and also to ben chamberleyns to lordes and
ladies.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn424" id="fnanc424">424</a></p>

<p>Courting popularity among all people, they were
different men and acted differently in the villages where
they made their rounds; to their wallet they added store
of thread, needles, ointments, with which they traded:</p>

<p>“Thei becomen pedleris, berynge knyves, pursis,
pynnys and girdlis and spices and sylk and precious pellure
and forrouris for wymmen, and therto smale gentil hondis
(dogs), to gete love of hem.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn425" id="fnanc425">425</a></p>

<p>They were more and more the subject of song and
cause of mirth, but they did not mind, being the better
advertised thereby:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpp02">“Thai wandren here and there,</div>
<div class="dpp00">And dele with dyvers marcerye,</div>
<div class="dpp02">Right as thai pedlers were.</div>
<div class="dpp00">Thai dele with purses, pynnes, and knyves,</div>
<div class="dpp00">With gyrdles, gloves, for
whenches and wyves.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn426"
id="fnanc426">426</a></div>
</div></div>

<p id="p308">The anonymous author, a contemporary of Chaucer,
adds:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>I

class="afnanc" href="#fn427" id="fnanc427">427</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>Between the scepticism of the century and blind
credulity, superstition flourished. The friars pretended
they could sell the merits of their order at retail. They
were so numerous and prayed so devoutly, that they had
a surplus of piyers in store. Why not distribute this
superfluous wealth to men of faith and good will? They
did so, for cash of course; it was an exchange of wealth;
like will to like. The friars went about the country discounting
these invisible riches, and selling to pious souls,
under the name of <i>letters of fraternity</i>, drafts upon heaven.
What is the use of these parchments? they were asked.
They give a share in the merits of the whole order of St.
Francis.—What are they good for? Wyclif was asked.
“Bi siche resouns thinken many men that thes lettris
mai do good for to covere mostard pottis.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn428" id="fnanc428">428</a></p>

<p>Discredited as they were at the end of the century,
the friars had not, however, lost all hold over the people.
Henry IV usurped the throne, and soon found that he
must reckon with the friars. A good many among them
were indignant at his enterprise, and some preached here
and there, during the first years of his reign, that Richard II
was still living and was the true king, and this was one
more case, and a very important one, of political ideas
vulgarised by wayfarers throughout the country. Henry IV
sent them to gaol. One who was
brought before him <span class="xxpn" id="p309">{309}</span>
reproached him violently for the deposition of Richard:
“But I have not usurped the crown, I have been elected,”
said the king.—“The election is null if the legitimate
king is living; if he is dead he is dead by thy means;
if he was killed by thee, thou canst have any title to the
throne.”—“By my head,” cried the prince, “I will have
thine cut off!”</p>

<p>The accused were advised to throw themselves on the
king’s mercy; they refused, and requested to be regularly
tried by a jury. Neither in the city nor in Holborn
could any one be found to sit on that jury; inhabitants
of Highgate and Islington had to be fetched for the purpose.
These men declared the friars guilty; the poor
wretches were drawn to Tyburn, hanged, then beheaded,
and their heads were placed on London Bridge (1402).
The convent was permitted to gather their remains, and
bury them in holy ground. The Islington and Highgate
jurors came weeping to the Franciscans to implore
their pardon for a verdict of which they repented.</p>

<p>For several years, in spite of these punishments, friars
continued to preach about the country in favour of
Richard II, maintaining that he still lived, although
Henry IV had taken care to have a public exhibition in
London of the corpse of his assassinated predecessor.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn429" id="fnanc429">429</a></p>

<p>In the fifteenth century the reputation of the friars
only grew worse. The abuses of which they were the
living personification were among those
which best served <span class="xxpn" id="p310">{310}</span>
to draw later adherents to Luther. If there remained in
their ranks men who knew how to die, like that unfortunate
friar Forest, who was hung alive by chains above a wood
fire and slowly roasted, while Bishop Latimer, himself to
be burnt later, addressed the dying man “with pious
exhortations” to repentance,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn430" id="fnanc430">430</a>
the mass of them remained
the object of universal contempt. This was one of the
few points on which it sometimes happened that Catholics
and Protestants agreed. Sir Thomas More, beheaded
for the Catholic faith, spoke of the friars in the same strain
as his adversary Tyndal, strangled for the Protestant
faith. In his eyes they were but dangerous vagabonds.
He relates, in his “Utopia,” the dispute between a friar
and a fool, on the question of pauperism. “&#x200a;‘You will
never,’ said the friar, ‘get rid of beggars, unless you also
make an edict against us friars.’ ‘Well,’ said the fool,
‘it is already made, the cardinal passed a very good law
against you when he decreed that all vagabonds should
be seized and made to work, for you are the greatest
vagabonds that can be.’ When this was said, and all
eyes being turned on the cardinal, they saw he did not
disown it; every one, not unwillingly, began to smile,
except the friar.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn431" id="fnanc431">431</a></p>

<p>A class, as historians have observed, which no longer
justifies its privileges by its services, is in imminent danger;
if it reforms in time, it may be saved; if it does not, it
is doomed. In England, the friars were doomed. But
nothing is ever entirely lost, and while, for centuries,
Chaucer’s merriment made people merry at the expense
of the begging orders, it is only fair, before parting with
them, to recall such an unprejudiced testimony
as that of <span class="xxpn" id="p311">{311}</span>
Bacon, in his essay “Of Love”: “There is in man’s
nature a secret inclination and motion towards love of
others, which, if it be not spent upon some one or a few,
doth naturally spread itself towards many, and maketh
men become humane and charitable; as it is seen sometime
in friars.”</p></div><!--section-->

<span class="hbig">THE PARDONERS</span></h3>

<p class="pfirst">“Indulgence” was at first simply a
commutation of penance. The pun­ish­ments inflicted for
sins were of long duration; fasting and mort­i­fi­ca­tion had
to be carried on for months and years. The faithful were
permitted to transform these interminable chas­tise­ments
into shorter expiation. Thus a clerk might exchange a
year of penance against three hundred lashes, reciting
a psalm at each hundred.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn432"
id="fnanc432">432</a> Tables of such exchanges were drawn
up by competent prelates. The learned and autocratic
Theodore, born at Tarsus, Cilicia, an en­cyc­lo­pædic mind and
a strong dis­ci­pli­nar­ian, arch­bishop of Cant­er­bury from 669
to 690, who left on the British church a permanent mark,
had published a tariff allowing people to be excused of a
month’s penance on bread and water if they sang instead
twelve hundred psalms with bended knees; for a year’s
penance the singing was increased, and each course of
psalter singing was accompanied with three hundred strokes
in the palm of the hand (<i>palmatæ</i>). But it was possible
to compensate <span class="xxpn" id="p313">{313}</span>
a year’s penance and escape at the same time the psalms,
fasts and strokes by paying a hundred shillings in alms.<a
class="afnanc" href="#fn433" id="fnanc433">433</a> In
another such table, drawn up in the ninth century by
Halitgarius, bishop of Cambrai, is found this additional
facility, that if the sinner, sentenced to a month’s
penance on bread and water, chooses rather the singing of
psalms he may be allowed not to kneel while he sings, but
then instead of twelve hundred he will have to sing fifteen
hundred and eighty psalms. He may in the same manner be
excused of more than one month, up to twelve, in which last
case, if he chooses not to kneel, he will have to sing no
less than twenty thousand one hundred and sixty psalms.<a
class="afnanc" href="#fn434" id="fnanc434">434</a></p>

<p>Laymen, who had their choice, frequently preferred
a payment in money, the rich having to pay more than
the poor, and the sums thus obtained were usually well
employed. We have seen them serve for the support
of roads and bridges; they were also applied in reconstructing
churches, in helping the sick of a hospital,
and in covering the expenses of numerous public enterprises.
The entirety of punishments was taken off by
a plenary indulgence; thus the French pope, Urban II,
at the Council of Clermont, in 1095, granted one to all
those who, through pure devotion and not to acquire
booty or glory, should go to Jerusalem to fight the
infidel; and this was the first crusade.</p>

<p>Little by little the idea of an actual commutation
vanished, and was replaced by a different system, known
as the theory of the “Treasury.” It had indeed become
obvious as the use of indulgences spread, and they were
more and more easily gained, that they could no longer
be justified as offering to the sinner only
his choice between <span class="xxpn" id="p314">{314}</span>
several sorts of even penances. They were something else.
A short, well selected prayer, a small gift in money,
would now exempt devout people from the greatest
penalties and from numberless years of a possible purgatory;
the one could scarcely be considered as the equivalent
of the other; how was the equilibrium established
between the two scales? The answer was that the
deficiency was made up by the application to the sinner
of merits, not indeed his own, but of Christ, the Virgin,
and the saints, of which there was an inexhaustible
“treasury,” the dispensation of which rested with the
Pope and the clergy.</p>

<p>This theory was acted upon long before being put
forth in express words; it does not appear to have been
more than vaguely alluded to before the fourteenth century,
when Pope Clement VI, the “Doctor Doctorum,”
gave a perfectly clear definition and exposition of the
“treasury” system. In a bull of the year 1350, he
explains that the merits of Christ are infinite, and those
of the Virgin and the saints, superabundant. This excess
of unemployed merit has been constituted into a treasury,
“not one that is deposited in a strong room, or concealed
in a field, but which is to be usefully distributed to the
faithful, through the blessed Peter, keeper of heaven’s
gate, and his successors.” However largely employed,
there ought to be “no fear of an absorption or a diminution
of this treasury, first on account of the infinite merits of
Christ, as has been said before, then because the more
numerous are the people reclaimed through the use of
its contents, the more it is augmented by the addition
of their merits.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn435" id="fnanc435">435</a>
The treasury had therefore no chance
of ever being found empty, since the more was drawn
from it the more it grew. Such is in all its simplicity
the theory of the “treasury,” which has ever since been
maintained, with no change in the theory but much in
the practice. <span class="xxpn" id="p315">{315}</span></p>

<p>With so much to distribute among the faithful, the
Church had recourse, for insuring its repartition, to certain
people who went about, supplied with official letters,
and who offered to good Christians a particle of the
heavenly wealth placed at the disposal of the successors
of Peter. They expected in return some portion of the
earthly riches their hearers might be possessed of, and
which could be applied to more tangible uses than the
“treasury.” The men entrusted with this mission were
called sometimes <i>questors</i>, on account of what they asked,
and sometimes <i>pardoners</i>, on account of what they gave.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn436" id="fnanc436">436</a></p>

<p>Many a man lives in our remembrance owing to his
portrait. If his image had not been preserved by an
artist of genius his memory would have been abolished.
Who would remember, but for her tomb at Lucca, lovely
Ilaria del Carretto? Many among us would not suspect
that the long vanished pardoner ever existed if the master-painter,
Chaucer, had not drawn, from life, his unlovely
portrait. “Lordyngs,” says the one in the “Canterbury
Tales”:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Lordyngs,

</div></div>

<p>In the pulpit he leans to the right, to the left, he
gesticulates, wanders in his talk; his arms move as much
as his tongue; it is a wonder to see and hear him:</p>

</div></div>

<p>The description may seem to-day improbable and
exaggerated, but it is not. A verifying from authentic
sources and a search for documents only shows once
more Chaucer’s marvellous exactness; not a trait in his
picture that may not be justified by letters from papal
or episcopal chanceries.</p>

<p>These <i>quæstores</i>, or <i>quæstiarii</i>, as they were officially
called, were, says Boniface IX, speaking at the very
time that the poet wrote his tales, sometimes secular
clerics and sometimes friars, most of them extremely
impudent. They dispensed with ecclesiastic licences,
and went from place to place delivering speeches, showing
their relics and selling their pardons. It was a lucrative
trade and the competition was great; the success of
authorized pardoners had caused a crowd of self-appointed
ones to issue from the school or the priory, or from
mere nothingness, greedy, with glittering eyes, as in the
“Canterbury Tales”: “suche glaryng eyghen hadde he
as an hare”; true vagabonds, infesters of the highroads,
who having, as they thought, nothing to fear,
boldly carried on their impostor’s traffic. They overawed
their listeners, spoke loud, and unbound upon
earth without scruple all that might be bound in heaven.
Much profit arose therefrom; Chaucer’s pardoner got
a hundred marks a year, which was easy enough for him,
since, having received no authority from any one, to no
one did he render any accounts, but kept all
the gains for <span class="xxpn" id="p317">{317}</span>
himself. In his measured language the Pope tells us as
much as the poet, and it seems as though he would duplicate,
line by line, the portrait drawn by the story-teller,
his contemporary.</p>

<p>First, says the pontifical letter, these pardoners swear
that they were sent by the Court of Rome. “Certain
religious, who even belong to one or the other of the
mendicant orders, and some secular clerks, even endowed
with privileged benefices, affirm that they are sent by us
or by the legates or the nuncios of the apostolic see, and
that they have received a mission to treat of certain
affairs, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to receive money for us and the Roman
Church, and they go about the country under these
pretexts.”</p>

<p>From Rome also comes Chaucer’s personage; he
moves about the country, and in exchange for his pardons
tirelessly asks for goods and money, which certainly will
not go to Rome:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpp09">“a gentil pardoner&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</div>

<div class="dpp00">Bret-ful of pardoun come from Rome al hoot.”</div></div>

<div class="dpp00">I wol have money, wolle, chese, and whete.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“Thus,” continues the Pope, “they proclaim to the
faithful and simple people (“the lewed people,” says
Chaucer’s man) the real or pretended authorizations
which they have received; and irreverently abusing
those which are real, in pursuit of
infamous and hateful <span class="xxpn" id="p318">{318}</span>
gain, they carry further their impudence by mendaciously
attributing to themselves false and pretended authorizations
of this kind.”</p>

<p>What does the poet say? That the charlatan has
ever fine things to show, that he knows how to dazzle
the simple, that he has his bag full of parchments with
awe-inspiring seals, maybe genuine, maybe not;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn437" id="fnanc437">437</a>
that
the people look on and admire, and the parson gets angry
but holds his tongue:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">

<div class="dpp00">And for to stere men to devocioun.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>As for that “turpem et infamem quæstum” branded
by the Pontiff, it is the ever-recurring burden of the
unholy discourse:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Now

<div class="dcaption">60. READING IN CANTERBURY
CATHEDRAL OF A FABRICATED PAPAL BULL, A.D. 1399.<div
class="fsz6">(<i>From the MS. Harl. 1319.</i>)</div>
</div></div></div>

<p id="p321">The effect of solemn parchments and large seals displayed
from the pulpit rarely failed upon the crowd, and
in some circumstances of more importance than the retail
selling of the merits of saints in heaven, recourse was
had to such exhibitions. When Henry of Lancaster
came to turn his cousin Richard II out of the English
throne, the first thing he did, according to Créton, was
to have a pretended papal bull, granting a plenary indulgence,
read from the pulpit of Canterbury cathedral and
commented by Archbishop Arundel (whose brother, the
earl, King Richard had caused to be summarily executed).
As Créton was not present when this scene, which he
describes only on hearsay, took place, the speech he
gives is the more interesting, for it may be considered an
average speech, such a one as was usual and likely to have
been pronounced on the occasion.</p>

<p>“My good people,” the Archbishop is supposed to
have said, “hearken all of you here: you well know how
the king most wrongfully and without reason has banished
your lord Henry; I have therefore obtained of the holy
father who is our patron, that those who shall forthwith
bring aid this day, shall every one of them have remission
of all sins whereby from the hour of their baptism they
have been defiled. Behold the sealed bull that the Pope
of renowned Rome hath sent me, my good friends, in
behalf of you all. Agree then to help him to subdue his
enemies, and you shall for this be placed after death with
those who are in Paradise.”</p>

<p>“Then,” continues the narrator, describing the effect
of the speech, “might you have beheld young and old, the
feeble and the strong, make a clamour, and regarding
neither right or wrong, stir themselves up with one accord,
thinking that what was told them was true, for such as
they have little sense or knowledge. The archbishop
invented this device&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”<a class="afnanc"
href="#fn438" id="fnanc438">438</a>
<span class="xxpn" id="p322">{322}</span></p>

<p>The burst of eloquence of Chaucer’s pardoner is a
caricature, but not an unrecognizable one, of the grave
discourses of this sort.</p>

<p>The Pope has still more to say: “For some insignificant
sum of money, they extend the veil of a lying
absolution not over penitents, but over men of a hardened
conscience who persist in their iniquity, remitting, to
use their own words, horrible crimes without there having
been any contrition nor fulfilment of any of the prescribed
forms.” It almost seems as if the Pope himself had
listened in disguise, on the road to Canterbury, to Chaucer’s
man saying:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>I

</div></div>

<p>Boccaccio, in one of the tales which he represents
himself as telling under the name of Dioneo, pictures,
he too, an ecclesiastic of great resemblance, moral and
physical, to Chaucer’s man. He was called Frà Cipolla,
and was accustomed to visit Certaldo, Boccaccio’s village
on the hill top, still very much now as it was then, with
the writer’s house conspicuous in the main street. “This
Frà Cipolla was little of person, red-haired (Chaucer’s
pardoner had “heer as yelwe as wex”) and merry of
countenance, the jolliest rascal in the world, and to boot,
for all he was no scholar, he was so fine a talker and so
ready of wit that those who knew him not would not
only have esteemed him a great
rhetorician, but had <span class="xxpn" id="p323">{323}</span>
avouched him to be Tully himself, or maybe, Quintilian;
and he was gossip, or friend, or well-wisher, to well-nigh
every one in the country.” If his hearers gave him a
little money or corn or anything, he would show them
the most wonderful relics; and besides they would enjoy
the special protection of the patron saint of his order,
St. Anthony: “Gentlemen and ladies, it is, as you know,
your usance to send every year to the poor of our lord
Baron St. Anthony of your corn and of your oats, this
little and that much, according to his means and his
devoutness, to the intent that the blessed St. Anthony
may keep watch over your beeves and asses and swine
and sheep; and, beside this, you use to pay, especially
such of you as are inscribed into our company, that small
due which is payable once a year.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn440" id="fnanc440">440</a></p>

<p>Such people had few scruples and knew how to profit
by those of others. They released their customers from
all possible vows, and remitted any penance, for money;
they were a living encouragement to sin, making it so
easy to atone for. The more prohibitions, obstacles, or
penances were imposed, the more their affairs prospered;
they passed their lives undoing what the real clergy did,
the richer for it, and the clergy the poorer. The Pope
again tells us: “For a small compensation they remit
vows of chastity, of abstinence, of pilgrimage beyond the
sea to Sts. Peter and Paul of Rome, or to St. James of
Compostela, and any other vows.” They allow heretics
to re-enter the bosom of the Church, illegitimate children
to receive the sacred orders, they remove excommunications
and interdicts; in short, as their power comes from
themselves alone, they see no reason to restrain it and
they use it to the full and without stint. Lastly, they
affirm that “it is in the name of the apostolic chamber
that they take all this money, and yet they
are never known <span class="xxpn" id="p324">{324}</span>
to give an account of it to any one: ‘Horret et merito
indignatur animus talia reminisci.’”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn441" id="fnanc441">441</a></p>

<p>They went yet further; they had formed regular
associations for systematically speculating on public credulity;
thus Boniface IX orders in 1390, that bishops
should make an inquiry into everything that concerns
these “religious or secular clerics, their people, their
accomplices, and their associations”; that they should
imprison them without other form of law, “de plano
ac sine strepitu et figura judicii”; should make them
render accounts, confiscate their receipts, and if their
papers be not in order hold them under good keeping,
and refer the matter to the sovereign pontiff.</p>

<p>There were indeed authorized pardoners who paid
the produce of their receipts into the treasury of the
Roman Court. The learned Richard d’Angerville, otherwise
de Bury, Bishop of Durham, called by Petrarch, whom
he had met at Avignon in 1330, “vir ardentis ingenii,”
speaks, in a circular of December 8, 1340, of apostolic
or diocesan letters, subject to a rigorous visa, with which
the regular pardoners had to be furnished.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn442" id="fnanc442">442</a>
But many
did without them, and the bishop notices one by one
the same abuses as the Pope and as Chaucer. “Strong
complaints have come to our ears that the questors of this
kind, not without great and rash boldness, of their own
authority, and to the great danger of the souls who are
confided to us, openly setting at nought our jurisdiction,
distribute indulgences to the people, dispense with the
execution of vows, absolve the perjured, homicides, usurers,
and other sinners who confess to them; and, for a little
money paid, grant remission for ill-atoned crimes, and
are given to a multitude of other abuses.” Henceforward
all curates, vicars and chaplains must refuse to admit
these pardoners to preach or
to bestow indulgences, <span class="xxpn" id="p325">{325}</span>
whether in the churches or anywhere else, “if they be
not provided with letters or a special licence” from the
bishop himself. And this was a most proper injunction,
for with these bulls brought from far-off lands, adorned
with unknown seals “of popes and of cardynales, of
patriarkes and of bisshops,” it was easy to make people
believe that all was in order. Meanwhile let all those
who are now wandering round the country be stripped
of what they have taken, and let “the money and <i>any
other articles</i> collected by them or on their behalf,” be
seized: the common people not being always possessed
of actual cash, Chaucer’s pardoner contented himself
with “silver spones, broches, or rynges.” One more
allusion is to be noticed in this text to those associations
of pardoners which must have been so harmful.</p>

<p>They employed, in fact, inferior agents; the general
credulity and the widespread wish to get rid of religious
trammels which men had imposed on themselves, in the
shape of vows or otherwise, or which had been imposed
on them on account of their sins, were a mine for the
perverse band, the veins of which they carefully worked.
By means of these subordinate representatives of their
fanciful power, they easily extended the field of their
operations, and the complicated threads of their webs
covered the whole kingdom, sometimes too strong to
be broken, sometimes too fine to be perceived.</p>

<p>Occasionally, too, the bad example came from very
high quarters; all had not the Bishop of Durham’s virtue.
Walsingham relates with indignation the behaviour of a
cardinal who made a stay in England when the marriage
between Richard II and the emperor’s sister, Anne of
Bohemia, was being negotiated. For money this prelate,
just like the common pardoners, removed excommunications,
dispensed people of pilgrimages to St. Peter,
St. James, or Jerusalem, and had the sum that would
have been spent on the journey duly
computed and given <span class="xxpn" id="p326">{326}</span>
to him;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn443" id="fnanc443">443</a>
and it is much to be regretted from every point
of view that the curious tariff of the expenses of a journey
thus estimated has not come down to us.</p>

<p>The list of the misdeeds of pardoners was in truth
enormous, and it is found even larger on exploring the
authentic ecclesiastical documents than in the work of
Chaucer himself. Thus in a bull of Pope Urban V,
dated 1369, mention is made of practices apparently
untried by the otherwise experienced “gentil pardoner
of Rouncival.” These doings were customary with those
employed by the Hospitallers of St. John of Jerusalem
in England. Helped by the connivance of the “very
priors” of the order, they pretended to be “privileged”
and exempted from the formality of showing apostolic
letters before they were allowed to proceed with their
preachings and to offer to the people their “negotia
quæstuaria.” The parish rectors and curates naturally
enough objected to such pretensions, but their complaints
were ill received, and the pardoners, to get rid of them,
sued them before some distant authority for contempt
of their cloth and privileges. While the suit was being
determined they remained free to act as they liked. Sometimes
they were so lucky as to secure sentence against
the priest who had tried to do his duty, and even succeeded
in having him excommunicated: which could of course
but be a cause of great merriment among the unholy tribe.</p>

<p>“Very often, also,” adds Pope Urban, “when they
mean to hurt a rector or his curate, they go to his church
on some feast-day, especially at such time as the people
are accustomed to come and make
their offerings. They <span class="xxpn" id="p327">{327}</span>
begin then to make their own collections or to read the
name of their brotherhood or fraternity, and continue
until such an hour as it is not possible to celebrate mass
conveniently that day. Thus they manage perversely to
deprive these rectors and vicars of the offerings which
accrue to them at such masses.” They have, on the
other hand, Divine service performed “in polluted or
interdicted places, and there also bury the dead; they
use, as helps to their trade, simple and almost illiterate
subordinates, who spread errors and fables among people
as ignorant as themselves.”</p>

<p>Such abuses and many others, constantly pointed out
by councils, popes, and bishops, moved the University
of Oxford to recommend, in the year 1414, the entire
suppression of pardoners, as being men of loose life and
lying speeches, spending their profits “with the prodigal
son,” remitting to sinners their sins as well as their
penances, encouraging vice by the ease of their absolutions,
and drawing the souls of uneducated people
“to Tartarus.” But this request was not listened to,
and pardoners continued to prosper for the moment.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn444" id="fnanc444">444</a></p>

<p>At the same time that they sold indulgences, the
pardoners showed relics. They had been on pilgrimage
and had brought back pieces of bone and fragments of
all kinds, of holy origin, they said. But although the
credulous were not lacking among the multitude, the
disabused among the better sort were numerous and they
scoffed without mercy. The pardoners of Chaucer and
Boccaccio, and in the sixteenth century of Heywood and
Lyndsay,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn445" id="fnanc445">445</a>
exhibited the most unexpected trophies. The
Chaucerian one, who possessed a piece of the
sail of St. <span class="xxpn" id="p328">{328}</span>
Peter’s boat is surpassed by Frate Cipolla, who had
brought back much better from Jerusalem. “I will,
as an especial favour, show you,” said he, “a very holy
and goodly relic, which I myself brought aforetime from
the Holy Lands beyond seas, and that is one of the
Angel Gabriel’s feathers, which remained in the Virgin
Mary’s chamber, whenas he came to announce to
her in Nazareth!”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn446" id="fnanc446">446</a>
The feather, which was from the
tail of a parrot, through some joke played upon him
was replaced in the holy man’s box by a few coals;
when he perceived the metamorphosis he showed
no embarrassment, but began the narrative of his long
voyages, and explained how, instead of the feather, the
coals on which St. Lawrence was grilled would be seen
in his coffer. He had received them from “My Lord
Blamemenot Anitpleaseyou,” the worthy patriarch of
Jerusalem, who also showed him “a finger of the Holy
Ghost as whole and sound as ever it was, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and one
of the nails of the cherubim, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. divers rays of the
star that appeared to the three Wise Men in the East,
and a vial of the sweat of St. Michael whenas he fought
with the devil”; he possessed also “somewhat of the
sound of the bells of Solomon’s Temple in a vial.”</p>

<p>Poets’ jests; but less exaggerated than might be
thought. Was there not shown to the pilgrims at Exeter
a bit “of the candle which the angel of the Lord lit in
Christ’s tomb”? This was one of the relics brought
together in the venerable cathedral by Athelstan, “the
most glorious and victorious king,” who had sent emissaries
at great expense on to the Continent to gather these
precious spoils. The list of their treasure-troves, which
has been preserved in a missal of the eleventh century,
comprises also a little of “the bush in which the Lord
spoke to Moses,” and a lot of
other curiosities.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn447" id="fnanc447">447</a>
Some <span class="xxpn" id="p329">{329}</span>
of the Virgin’s milk was, as all know, venerated at
Walsingham and in various other places.</p>

<p>Matthew Paris relates that, in his time, the friar
preachers gave to Henry III a piece of white marble on
which there was the trace of a human foot; nothing
less, according to the testimony of the inhabitants of
the Holy Land, than the mark of one of the Saviour’s
feet, left by Him as a souvenir to His apostles after His
Ascension. “Our lord the king had this marble placed
in the church of Westminster, to which he had already
lately offered some of the blood of Christ.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn448" id="fnanc448">448</a></p>

<p>In the fourteenth century kings continued to set the
example to the common people, and to collect relics of
undemonstrable authenticity. In the accounts of the
expenses of Edward III, in the thirty-sixth year of his
reign, a hundred shillings are put down for a messenger
who had brought him a vest of St. Peter’s.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn449" id="fnanc449">449</a>
In France,
at the same period, King Charles V “le sage” had one
day the curiosity to visit the cupboard at the Sainte
Chapelle, where the relics of the passion were kept. He
found there a phial with a Latin and Greek inscription
indicating that it contained some of the blood of Jesus
Christ. “Then,” relates Christine de Pisan, “that wise
king, because some doctors have said that, on the day
that our Lord rose, nothing was left on earth of His
worthy body that was not all returned into Him, would
hereupon know and inquire by learned men, natural
philosophers, and theologians, whether it could be true
that upon earth there were some of the real pure blood
of Jesus Christ. Examination was made by the said
learned men assembled about this matter; the said phial
was seen and visited with great reverence and solemnity
of lights, in which when it was hung
or lowered could <span class="xxpn" id="p330">{330}</span>
be clearly seen the fluid of the red blood flow as freshly
as though it had been shed but three or four days since:
which thing is no small marvel, considering the passion
was so long ago. And these things I know for certain
by the relation of my father who was present at that
examination, as philosophic officer and counsellor of the
said prince.”</p>

<p>After this examination made by great “solemnity of
lights,” the doctors declared themselves for the authenticity
of the miracle;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn450" id="fnanc450">450</a>
which was not in reality more
surprising than that at the cathedral at Naples, where the
blood of the patron saint of the town may still be seen to
liquify several times a year, and for several days each time.</p>

<p>In every country of Europe the pardoners en­joyed, not
to say en­dured, the same rep­u­ta­tion and acted in the same
man­ner. Be it France, Germany, Italy, or Spain, they were
found living, so long as there re­mained any, as Chaucer’s
par­don­er did. In France, Rabelais has the cheaters cheated
by his beloved Panurge. The clever <i>vaurien</i> used to place
his penny in their plate so skil­fully that it seemed to
be a silver piece: for which he made bold to take change,
leaving only a farth­ing. “&#x200a;‘And I did the same,’
said he, ‘in all the churches where we have been.’—‘Yea,
but,’ said I, ‘you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. are a thief, and com­mit
sac­ri­lege.’—‘True,’ said he, ‘as it seems to you; but it
does not seem so to me. For the par­don­ers give it me as
a gift when they say, in of­fer­ing me the relics to kiss:
<i>Cen­tup­lum ac­ci­pies</i>—that is, that for one pen­ny I take
a hundred; for <i>ac­ci­pies</i> is spok­en by them ac­cord­ing
to the man­ner of the He­brews, who use the fu­ture tense
in­stead of the im­per­a­tive, as you have in the book,
<i>Dil­iges Dom­i­num, id est,</i>
<span class="nowrap"><i>dilige</i>.’&#x200a;”<a class="afnanc"
href="#fn451" id="fnanc451">451</a></span> <span class="xxpn"
id="p331">{331}</span></p>

<p>Pardoners, of course, never appear on the boards of
the old French theatre, but to be derided:</p>

<p>“<i>Pardoner</i>: I mean to show you the comb of the
cock that crowed at Pilate’s, and half a plank of Noah’s
great ark. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Look, gentlemen, here is a feather of
one of the seraphs near God. Don’t think it is a joke;
here it is for you to see.</p>

<p>“<i>Triacleur</i>: Gogsblood! ’tis the quill from a goose
he has eaten at his dinner!” and so on.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn452" id="fnanc452">452</a></p>

<p>The same in Spain. Lazarillo de Tormes, the page
of many masters, happens, at one time, to be in the service
of a pardoner: the very same individual Chaucer had
described two hundred years before. He, too, knows
how to use Latin when profitable: “Hee woulde alwayes
bee informed before he came, which were learned and
which not. When he came to those which he understood
were learned, he woulde be sure never to speake worde
of Latin, for feare of stumbling: but used in suche places
a gentle kind of Castilian Spanish, his tong alwayes at
libertie. And contrariwise whensoever hee was informed
of the reverend <i>Domines</i> (I meane such as are made priestes
more for money than for learning and good behaviour), to
hear him speake amongs suche men you would saye it
were St. Thomas: for hee woulde then two houres together
talke Latin, at lest which seemed to bee, though
it was not.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn453" id="fnanc453">453</a>
A trick which, as is well known, Sganarelle,
many years after, did not disdain to use when put upon
his last shifts as the “Médecin malgré lui.”</p>

<p>Pardoners lived merrily; certain it is that after a
busy day they must have been cheerful companions at
the inn. The thought of the multitude of sins they
had pardoned, of excommunications
they had removed, <span class="xxpn" id="p332">{332}</span>
of penalties they had remitted—themselves mere vagabonds
threatened with the jail or gallows—the knowledge
of their impunity, the strangeness of their existence, the
triumphant success of the mad harangues in which they
attributed to themselves the keys of heaven, must have
made their hearts swell with uncontrollable merriment.
Their heads were filled with anecdotes, sacred or profane;
native coarseness and assumed devotion, the real and the
artificial man, jostled each other to the sound of jugs and
vessels clattering on the table. See in the margin of an
old psalter the lean figure of Master Reynard<a class="afnanc" href="#fn454" id="fnanc454">454</a>: a crozier
between his paws, a mitre on his head, he is preaching
a sermon to the wondering crowd of ducks and geese of
the poultry yard. The gesture is full of unction, but
the eye shaded by the tawny hair has a cruel glitter, which
ought to give warning of the peroration. But no, the
poultry yard clucks devoutly and fears nothing; woe to
the ducks when the mitre has fallen: “And Thou, Lord,
shalt laugh at them,” says the psalmist on the same page.</p>

<p>A singular knowledge of the human heart those individuals
must have had, going through such strange
experiences day by day. Never were more unworthy
beings supposedly clothed with greater supernatural powers.
The deformed monster squatting on the apse of the cathedral
laughs and grimaces hideously on his airy pedestal.
And up to the clouds rise the fretted spires; the
chiselled pinnacles detach themselves like lace upon the
sky; the saints pray their eternal prayer under the porch;
the bells send forth their peals into space, and souls are
seized with a thrill, with that mysterious awe caused by
the sublime. The monster laughs; hearts believe themselves
purified, but he has seen their ugly sores, a sinister
hand will touch them and prevent their
cure; the edge <span class="xxpn" id="p333">{333}</span>
of the roof reaches the clouds; but his look goes
through the dormer window, he detects a cracking beam,
worm-eaten boards giving way, and a host of obscure
creatures slowly pursuing under the wooden shafts their
secular labour of destruction: he laughs and grimaces
hideously.</p>

<p>On the tavern bench the pardoner is still seated.
There come Chaucer, the knight, the squire, the friar,
the host—old acquaintances. We are by ourselves, no
one need be afraid to speak, the foaming ale renders
hearts expansive; and the unseen coils of that tortuous
soul unfold to view, he gives the summary of a whole
life, the theory of his existence, the key to his secrets.
What matters his frankness? he knows that it cannot
hurt him; time and again has the bishop brought his
practices to light, but the crowd always troops around
him. And who knows if his companions—who knows
if his more enlightened companions, to whom he shows
the concealed springs of the automaton—will, to-morrow,
believe it lifeless? their memory, their reason will tell
them so, yet still their heart will doubt. If custom is
the half of belief, theirs is well-rooted; how much more
that of the multitude! And the pardoner himself, do
you suppose that he always sees clearly what he is, do
you think that his scepticism is absolute? he for whom
nothing is holy, whose very existence is a perpetual
mockery of sacred things, he also has his hours of doubt
and terror, he trembles before that formidable power
which he said he held in his hands, and of which he has
made a toy; he does not possess it, but others may, and he
stands aghast; the monster looks upon himself and is
afraid.</p>

<p>Very easy it was to lead the popular belief into the
channel of the marvellous. Decrees had been deemed
necessary to prevent the conjuring up of spectres or ghosts
in those long watches passed with
the dead; disobedience <span class="xxpn" id="p334">{334}</span>
was attempted, people believed they succeeded. In
presence of the horrible a strange reaction of the heart
would take place, a wind of madness passed predisposing
men to see and believe anything, a nervous and demoniacal
merriment seized upon all, and dances and lascivious
games were started. Dancing went on in the cemeteries
during the solemn vigils of religious feasts, there was
dancing also during the watch for the dead. The Council
of London, in 1342, prohibited “the superstitious customs
which cause prayer to be neglected, and unlawful and
indecent meetings” held in such places.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn455" id="fnanc455">455</a>
The Council
of York, in 1367, also forbade “those guilty games and
follies, and all those perverse customs .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. which transform
a house of tears and prayers, into a house of laughing
and excess.” The palmers’ gild of Ludlow allowed its
members to go to night-watches of the dead, provided
that they abstained from raising apparitions and from
indecent games.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn456" id="fnanc456">456</a>
As to professional sorcerers, the belief
in them was so profound that they were sent to the stake,
as happened to Petronilla of Meath, convicted of having
manufactured powders with “spiders and black worms
like scorpions, mingling with them a certain herb called
milfoil, and other detestable herbs and worms.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn457" id="fnanc457">457</a>
She
had also made such incantations that “the faces of certain
women seemed horned like the
heads of goats”; <span class="xxpn" id="p335">{335}</span>
therefore she had her due punishment and “was burnt before
an immense multitude of people with all the accustomed
ceremonial.” Such facts explain the existence of the
pardoner.</p>

<p>Let us add that the search for the philosopher’s stone
was the constant occupation of many renowned doctors;
every one had not that clear good sense, good humour
and penetrating spirit which permitted Chaucer to smilingly
unravel before us the mysteries of the alchemist,
shaking the alembics and retorts, and in the odd-shaped
apparatus which frightened the imagination, showing not
the newly created ingot of pure metal, but the mixture
prepared beforehand by the impostor.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn458" id="fnanc458">458</a>
Not a plant or
a stone without supernatural virtues; the vain beliefs
inherited from the ancients had been rejuvenated and
expanded. People thirsted for such pretended learning.
Gower thinks he does well to insert in a love poem all
he believes he knows on the constitution of the world
and the virtues of things;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn459" id="fnanc459">459</a>
even with professionally
learned men the mass of fabulous statements fills volumes.
Bartholomew the Englishman, whose work is an encyclopædia
of scientific knowledge in the thirteenth century,
is positive that the diamond destroys the effect of venom
and of magic incantations, and that it reveals its wearer’s
fear; that the topaz prevents sudden death, etc.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn460" id="fnanc460">460</a></p>

<p>A pleasure it is, and like a whiff of fresh air when
emerging from a damp cellar, to remember that in an
age not totally exempt from these weaknesses no one
condemned them with more eloquence than our Molière:
“Without speaking of other things,” said
he, “I have <span class="xxpn" id="p336">{336}</span>
never been able to conceive how even the smallest peculiarities
of the fortune of the least man could be found
written in the skies. What relation, what intercourse,
what correspondence can there be between us and worlds
separated from our earth by so frightful a distance? and
whence can this fine science have come to men? What
god has revealed it? or what experience can have shaped
it from the observation of that great number of stars which
have not been seen twice in the same arrangement?”</p>

<p>Trouble and eloquence lost; there will always be a

twenty-first session of the œcumenical council of Trent,
July 16, 1562, Pius IV being Pope. It is stated in the
ninth chapter of the “Decree of Reform,” published in
that session, that since “no further hope can be entertained
of amending the questors of alms” (<i>eleemosynarum
quæstores</i>), otherwise pardoners, “the use of them and
their name are entirely abolished henceforth in all Christendom:”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn462" id="fnanc462">462</a>

disappear.</p></div><!--section-->

<h3 class="h3chap">CHAPTER III
<span class="hbig">PILGRIMS AND PILGRIMAGES</span></h3>

<h4>I</h4>

<p class="pfirst">In spite of the merits of physicians, soothsayers,
and sorcerers, maladies sometimes resisted the best
remedies, and the patient would then vow to go
on a pilgrimage, ride, walk, or have himself carried
there, and pray for his cure. He went to our Lady of
Walsingham, for example, or to St. Thomas of Canterbury,
whose medical powers were considered, beyond
comparison, the best of all: “Optimus egrorum, medicus
fit Thomas bonorum,” was the motto stamped on some
of the pewter ampullæ, with miraculous water in them,
which pilgrims brought back as a souvenir from Canterbury:
“For good people that are sick, Thomas is the
best of physicians.” And surely praying at his shrine,
after an open-air journey on foot or horseback, was a better
way of preserving one’s health than swallowing the black
beetles and fat bats of John of Gaddesden, the court
physician. <span class="xxpn" id="p339">{339}</span></p>

<p>Pilgrimages were incessant; they were made to
fulfil a vow as in cases of illness or of great peril, or in
expiation of sins. Confessors frequently gave the going
on a pilgrimage as penance, and sometimes ordered that
the traveller should go barefoot or in his shirt. “Commune
penaunce,” says Chaucer’s parson in his great
sermon, speaking of atonement which must be public,
“commune,” because the sin has been public too, “is
that prestes enjoynen men comunly in certeyn caas, as
for to goon, peradventure, naked in pilgrimage or barfot,”
that is to say, naked in their shirts. In accordance with
a vow made during a tempest, Æneas Sylvius Piccolomini,
later Pope Pius II, walked ten miles barefoot on the frozen
ground, to White Kirk, near North Berwick, and had, on
his return, “to be born, rather than led by his servants.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn463" id="fnanc463">463</a></p>

<p>Another motive for pilgrimages, and, more than any
other, characteristic of the times, was to annoy the king.
Thus in the fourteenth century English people flocked
to the tomb of the selfish, narrow-minded and vengeful
Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, of whom popular prejudice
had made a saint.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn464" id="fnanc464">464</a>
The crowd hastened through a spirit
of opposition to Pontefract, where the rebel had been
decapitated, by order of his relative, King Edward II, and
the pilgrims became every year more numerous, to the
great scandal of the sovereign and of the Archbishop of
York. A letter of this prelate shows the
uselessness of the <span class="xxpn" id="p340">{340}</span>
prohibitions: the idea of a semblance of persecution of
believers devised by an archbishop only excited zeal and
devotion; men hoped to please the martyr by allowing
themselves to be slightly martyred. Thus, while awaiting
a canonization that never came, though insisted upon by the
next king, crowds collected near the tomb, so numerous
and tumultuous that there happened “homicides and
mortal wounds, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and that greater dangers yet and
doubtless most imminent are to be feared.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn465" id="fnanc465">465</a></p>

<p>All this began the very year after the execution of the
“saint.” The official was enjoined to hinder these
meetings by any means, and to disperse them until the
Pope should pronounce. But the gatherings continued,
and Henry of Lancaster wrote in 1327 to the Archbishop
of York asking him to refer the matter to the Sovereign
Pontiff, and “bear witness to the fame of the miracles
which God works by our very dear lord and brother.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn466" id="fnanc466">466</a>
The same year the Commons took the question in hand
and petitioned for the canonization of the same Thomas,
which was scarcely parliamentary business.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn467" id="fnanc467">467</a>
In 1338,
a London pepperer had for sale a mazer bowl ornamented
with an “image of St. Thomas of Lancester.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn468" id="fnanc468">468</a>
Humphrey
de Bohun, Earl of Hereford and Essex, who died
in 1361, bequeathed money for pious men to make a
variety of pilgrimages on his behalf, and he specially
recommended that “a good man and
true” should be <span class="xxpn" id="p341">{341}</span>
hired and charged to go to “Pountfreyt and to offer
there, at the tomb of Thomas, late earl of Lancaster, 40s.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn469" id="fnanc469">469</a></p>

<p>To make a saint of a rebel was the most energetic
means of protesting against the king, and the people
would not miss this opportunity under some of their
sovereigns. Henry III, in 1266, had been obliged to
forbid Simon de Montfort being considered as a saint,
although Simon having died under excommunication, as
was represented to the king by the bishops and barons,
authors of the petitions comprised in the “Dictum de
Kenilworth,”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn470" id="fnanc470">470</a>
had little chance of ever being canonized.
Latin hymns were nevertheless composed in his honour,
as for a saint.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn471" id="fnanc471">471</a></p>

<p>The rebel was hardly dead than popular feeling,
often unfavourable to him during his life, forthwith
recognized in him nothing else than the hero who had
fought against a tyrant, and, through sympathy for the
man, or antipathy for the king, assigned therefore to him
a place in heaven. The active
revolt, rudely interrupted <span class="xxpn" id="p342">{342}</span>
by punishment, continued thus in the latent state, and
every one came to see God Himself take the part of the
oppressed, and proclaim the injustice of the ruler by
working miracles at the tomb of his victim. The sovereign
defended himself as he could; he dispersed the rabble
and prohibited the miracles.</p>

<p class="pcontinue">read an ironical distich written in France in the “Diacre
Paris” days. Similarly disposed, Edward II, on October 2,
1323, wrote “to his faithful John de Stonore and
John de Bousser,” ordering an inquiry which would
be followed by graver measures. He recalled to them
that “a little time ago Henry de Montfort and Henry
de Wylynton, our enemies and rebels, on the advice of
the royal Court, were drawn and hanged at Bristol, and
it had been decided that their bodies should remain attached
to the gibbet, so that others might abstain from similar
crimes and misdeeds against us.” But on the contrary,
the people made relics of these bloody and mutilated
remains, and surrounded them with respect. Reginald
de Montfort, William de Clyf, William Curteys, and
John his brother, and some others, in order to render
the king odious to the people, had organized false miracles
at the gibbet where the corpses of these rebels were still
hanging, which was nothing short of “idolatry.”</p>

<p>Severe measures were required in several places at the
same time; while these bodies were venerated at Bristol,
a mere image of Thomas of Lancaster, in the Cathedral
of London, was attracting pilgrims and working miracles.
In this same year, 1323, on June 28th, Edward II is found
writing with great irritation to the Bishop of London:</p>

<p>“It has come to our ears—and it is very displeasing
to us—that many among the people of God, confided to
your charge, victims of a diabolical
trickery, crowd round <span class="xxpn" id="p343">{343}</span>
a panel placed in your church of St. Paul’s, where are
to be seen statues, sculptures, or images, and among
others that of Thomas, late Earl of Lancaster, a rebel,
our enemy. Silly visitors, without any authorization
from the Roman Church, venerate and worship this
image as a holy thing, and affirm that it there works
miracles: this is a disgrace for the whole Church, a shame
for us and for you, a manifest danger for the souls of
the aforesaid people, and a dangerous example to others.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn472" id="fnanc472">472</a></p>

<p>The bishop knows it, continues the king, and secretly
encourages these practices without any other motive
than that of profiting by the offerings, thus making
“shameful gains. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. By which,” adds Edward II, “we
are deeply afflicted.” The usual prohibitions follow.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn473" id="fnanc473">473</a></p>

<p>These were occasional pilgrimages. Others were in
favour for a much longer time owing to the reputation
of the departed for sanctity, and not to political motives.
For many years crowds came, as we have seen, to visit
the tomb of Richard Rolle, the hermit of Hampole.
Even in this, fashion ruled; some relics or tombs of hermits
or of saints enjoyed for a period universal favour;
then all of a sudden, through some great miracle, another
saint rose to pre-eminence, and the others, by degrees,
sank into obscurity.</p>

<p>Convents, which had neither relics nor bodies of
illustrious saints to attract pilgrims, nor a marvellous thorn-tree
like that of Glastonbury, would have sometimes a pious
artist to fabricate an image fit to draw visitors; it would
be inaugurated with solemnity, work miracles, it was hoped,
and enjoy a more or less wide fame. Thomas of Burton,
Abbot of Meaux, near Beverley, relates in the chronicle
of his rich monastery, written by himself at the end of
the fourteenth century, one of the most remarkable facts
of this kind. Abbot Hugh of Leven,
one of his <span class="xxpn" id="p344">{344}</span>
predecessors, had in the first half of the century ordered a new
crucifix for the choir of the chapel: “And the artist
never worked at any fine and important part, except on
Fridays, fasting on bread and water. And he had all
the time a naked man under his eyes, and he laboured
to give to his crucifix the beauty of the model. By the
means of this crucifix, the Almighty worked open miracles
continually. It was then thought that if access to this
crucifix were allowed to women, the common devotion
would be increased and great advantages would result
from it for our monastery. Upon which the Abbot of
Citeaux, by our request, granted us leave to let men and
honest women approach the said crucifix, provided,
however, that the women did not enter the cloister, the
dormitory, and other parts of the monastery.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But
profiting by this license, to our misfortune, women began
to come in increasing numbers to the said crucifix, while
in them devotion is cool, and all they want is to see the
church, and they increase our expenses by our having
to receive them.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn474" id="fnanc474">474</a></p>

<p>This naïve complaint is interesting from several points
of view; it plainly shows what was done to bring such
or such a sanctuary into favour with the pilgrims;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn475" id="fnanc475">475</a>
in
the present case the effort did not succeed, the prodigies
do not seem to have long responded
to the expectation, <span class="xxpn" id="p345">{345}</span>
and people came only from curiosity to visit the church
and the fine crucifix of the monastery. From the artistic
point of view the fact is still more important, for this is
the most ancient example of sculpture from the nude
living model to be found in mediæval England; and this
anonymous sculptor ought to be remembered, which he
is not, as one of the precursors of the Renaissance in his
country.</p>

<p>Another attempt to make a chapel popular had been
tried in the parochial church of Foston; but the Archbishop
of York, William Grenefeld, was scandalized, and
by a letter full of good sense put an end to the “great
concourse of simple people who came to visit a certain
image of the Holy Virgin recently placed in the church,
as if this image had something more divine than any other
images of the sort.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn476" id="fnanc476">476</a></p>

<p>The fact was, as may be noticed even in our days,
that, with or without the co-operation of the clergy, some
statues had a far better reputation than others; wonders
were expected of them, and they were worshipped accordingly;
the same vicissitudes were observable for images
as for relics and tombs of saints. This statue had healed
sick people without number, and that one was known to
have moved, to have made a sign, to have spoken a word.
Pictures of miracles worked by statues constantly recur
in manuscripts; one, for instance, is to be found in
several English books of the fourteenth century.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn477" id="fnanc477">477</a>
It
shows how a poor painter, being busy
colouring and gilding <span class="xxpn" id="p346">{346}</span>
a statue of the Virgin, with a most ugly devil under her
feet, the Evil One, angry at such an unflattering portrait,
came and broke the ladder on which the artist was
standing; but as he was falling and about to be killed,
the stone Virgin bent towards him, and extending her
arm held him safe until help came.</p>

<p>Statues did not always act so graciously, but were
guided by circumstances, as was seen in the church of
St. Paul-extra-muros at Rome. A visitor, according to
the relation of the learned Thomas Gascoigne, chancellor
of Oxford, had insulted the image of the saint, saying:
“&#x200a;‘Why hast thou got a sword, I mean to have thy sword,’
and he was trying to take it out of the hands of the statue.
But through God’s doing, the statue raised its sword on
the impious man, and clove his head to the chin; and
then death followed. This happened at the time when
Eugene IV was Pope of Rome, and a witness of the scene
reported it to me; this witness was a beadel of the said
Pope, called Master Erasmus Fullar, a priest of the
kingdom of Hungary.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn478" id="fnanc478">478</a></p>

<h4>II</h4>

<p>Apart from pilgrimages, in fashion but for a time,
English people usually went to Durham to visit the tomb
of the holy Confessor Cuthbert, and the place where was
kept his ever-victorious banner; to the shrine of King
Edward the Confessor in Westminster; to St. Albans,
St. Edmund’s Bury, St. David’s, on account of the saints
after whom these towns are named; to Chichester, to
worship the body of St. Richard the Bishop; to Glastonbury,
with its holy thorn-tree, and
its church founded <span class="xxpn" id="p347">{347}</span>
by St. Joseph of Arimathea; to Waltham, where a cross
of black marble had been miraculously found in the time
of King Knut. Lincoln, York, Peterborough, Hayles with
its Holy Blood, Winchester (for St. Swithin, who, among
other merits, had had that of being a bridge builder), Holywell,
Beverley with its St. John, and a number of other
places,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn479" id="fnanc479">479</a>
shrines and miraculous and wishing wells had
also attractions for the pilgrim; but none could stand
comparison with Walsingham and Canterbury.</p>

<p>At Walsingham there were a church and a chapel, now
destroyed, the latter with a miraculous bejewelled statue of
the Virgin, and some of her milk, the chapel being exactly
similar, it was said, to the Santa Casa of Loretto, which
was a wonder in itself, for the English copy had been built
in the eleventh century, long before the Casa was heard
of. Owing to innumerable gifts the place was resplendent
with gold and precious stones. Visiting Cologne
and the famous shrine of the wise men of the East, Roger
Ascham writes: “The three kings be not so rich, I believe,
as was the Lady of Walsingham.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn480" id="fnanc480">480</a>
People came in
crowds; many among the British kings came too;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn481" id="fnanc481">481</a>
the road leading to Walsingham was called the palmers’
way, and chapels were built along its line. The town
was full of inns, hospitals, and religious buildings, as
was usually the case with the more famous of these
places.</p>

<p>The milk and the image, as most of the pilgrimage
statues, were destroyed at the Reformation, some of the
wooden ones being burnt like the heretics, or with them,
at Smithfield, as happened when Friar
Forest died at <span class="xxpn" id="p348">{348}</span>
the stake.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn482" id="fnanc482">482</a>
The gold and silver ones were turned to
more practical uses. “I have pullyd down,” Dr. London,
one of the Visitors of religious houses, writes to Thomas
Cromwell, “the image of our Lady at Caversham, wherunto
wasse great pilgremage. The image ys platyd over
with sylver, and I have putte yt in a cheste fast lackyd
(locked) and naylyd uppe, and by the next bardge that
commyth from Redyng to London yt shall be browght
to your Lordeschippe. I have also pullyd down the place
she stode in with all other ceremonyes, as lights, schrds
(shrouds), crowchys (crosses), and imagies of wex hangyng
about the chapel, and have defacyed the same thorowly
in exchuyng of any farther resortt thedyr. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. At
Caversham ys a propre lodginge wher the chanon lay,
with a fayer garden and an orchard mete to be bestowed
upon som frynde of your lordeschip’s in thees
parties.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn483" id="fnanc483">483</a></p>

<p>In especially large numbers people hired horses at
Southwark, with relays at Rochester, and set out for St.
Thomas of Canterbury. This was the highroad to the
continent; a regular service of hired horses had been
established along it. Twelvepence was paid from Southwark
to Rochester, twelvepence from Rochester to Canterbury,
sixpence from Canterbury to Dover. The horses
were branded in a prominent manner, so that unscrupulous
travellers should not be tempted to quit the road and
appropriate their steeds.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn484" id="fnanc484">484</a>
The sanctuary of St. Thomas
had, indeed, a world-wide reputation.</p>

<p>We can scarcely realize now the thrill of horror that
went throughout Christendom, as far as the Levant, as
far as Iceland, when the news
came that Archbishop <span class="xxpn" id="p349">{349}</span>
Thomas Becket,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn485" id="fnanc485">485</a>
Legate of the Pope, former chancellor
of England, had been massacred in his cathedral of Canterbury
by four knights of Henry II, on the evening of
Tuesday, December 29, 1170, his brain and blood splashing
the pavement. Everything combined to increase the
enormity of the crime; the holiness of the place, which
should have afforded sanctuary, even to a murderer, the
rank of the victim in the hierarchy of the Church, the
dying man’s brave and pious words, the presence of
the cross born at his side by his assistant, Edward Grim,
himself severely wounded, and, above all, the fame and
character of the prelate, an archbishop Turpin of real
life, who, like the companion of Roland, and while already
engaged in holy orders, had proved a plucky military
leader, unimpeachable, moreover, from the moral point
of view, and fearless throughout his life. Like the
Archbishop of Reims of the “Song of Roland,” whose
brain had flowed down his face,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn486" id="fnanc486">486</a>
he had died at the hands
of barbarians, who had not, however, the excuse of
being infidels.</p>

<p>Rarely did a single act cause such universal indignation.
Public opinion proclaimed Thomas a saint even before
the Pope could take action, which he did, however, with
a promptitude rare in such cases, canonization being
proclaimed in February, 1173. The body was scarcely
buried in the crypt of the cathedral,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn487" id="fnanc487">487</a>
than pilgrims came
to it, their numbers ceaselessly increasing. The life of
the archbishop was the subject of
numberless miniatures,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn488" id="fnanc488">488</a>
<span class="xxpn" id="p350">{350}</span>
sculptures,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn489" id="fnanc489">489</a>
painted windows. Some of the latter, dating
back to the thirteenth century, still remain at Canterbury,
Sens, Chartres, and other places. Matthew Paris wrote
and illuminated with his own hand, Walsingham tells
us, a biography of the archbishop; churches dedicated
to him multiplied in England and out of England: “On
the heights of Fourvières,” wrote Dean Stanley, “overlooking
the city of Lyons, is a chapel dedicated to Saint
Thomas of Canterbury. Four years before his death,
it is said, he was walking on the terraced bank of the
river underneath, and being asked to whom the chapel
should be dedicated, he replied, ‘To the next martyr,’
on which his companion remarked, ‘Perhaps, then, to
you.’”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn490" id="fnanc490">490</a></p>

<p>The prophecy was fulfilled. Entirely renovated,
and forming now part of the pilgrimage church at
Fourvières, such a chapel still exists, still dedicated to
St. Thomas; it has been allotted to the fraternity
of “Notre Dame de Compassion” for their exercises,
which consist chiefly in praying for the conversion of
England. On the threshold are engraved four riming
Latin lines: “Happy the place, happy the church where
Thomas’s memory survives; happy the land which gave
birth to the prelate, happy that which received him, an
exile.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn491" id="fnanc491">491</a></p>

<p>Churches dedicated to him were especially numerous
in Normandy, from which his family came,
a chapel at <span class="xxpn" id="p351">{351}</span>
Caen bearing the grim name of “Saint Thomas l’Abattu”
(the stricken down). His life was told in verse and
prose, in Latin, French, Icelandic, the most noteworthy
of those lives being that in French verse by Garnier de
Pont-Sainte-Maxence, as remarkable for its literary as
for its historical value, the author, a contemporary, having
taken as much pains to ascertain the truth as would the
most conscientious of the historians of to-day.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn492" id="fnanc492">492</a>
He had
begun writing two years after the event, and had
remodelled several times his poem because new documents,
of which several are versified into his text, or new facts
had come to his knowledge. He established himself at
“Chantorbire,” where every man, every stone had been
a witness, and he appealed, in order to learn the truth,
to the friends, the servants, the sister of Saint Thomas.
His work was thereby delayed, but he preferred that:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpp00">A Chantorbire alai; la vérité oï;</div>
<div class="dpp00">Des amis saint Thoma la vérité cuilli,</div>
<div class="dpp00">Et de cels ki l’aveient dès l’enfance servi,</div>
<div class="dpp00">D’oster et de remettre le travail en suffri.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Proud of the trouble he had taken, he was proud also of
the good French he spoke, far better, of course, than that
of ordinary Anglo-Norman writers: “My language is
good, for I was born in France.” He thereupon submits
to the custom, not yet quite obsolete, of abusing those
who write on the same subject. Don’t forget, he says
to his readers in the first lines of his poem, that “all
physicians are not good healers; and it is not all clerks
who know how to well sing and well read. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Some
claim to be the best, and are in reality the worst.” He,
however, claims to be the best; and though his boast
may incline us to be the more critical, yet we must needs
grant that it is not groundless,
considering his accuracy, <span class="xxpn" id="p352">{352}</span>
the excellence of his French, the lifelike vividness of his
scenes and dialogues, the interest of the views and sentiments,
at times very liberal, expressed by him: “God
loves the humble and the poor, who live by their work,
whose every day is a hard one .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and who lead clean
lives; God will exalt them.”</p>

<p>To the mass of pilgrims who from the earliest moment
had begun to visit Canterbury, Garnier, “standing by
the tomb, a number of times read his sermon about Saint
Thomas the martyr and his passion. And they heard
nothing but truth absolute.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn493" id="fnanc493">493</a></p>

<p>Great and small, by land and by sea, from every part
of Christendom, “men of foreign countries, of a variety
of languages,” says Garnier, flocked henceforth to the
place in such numbers, that the road, followed by pilgrims
from the West of England, or by foreigners from abroad,
landing at Southampton, to reach Canterbury by way of
Winchester, was, and is still, called “The Pilgrims’ Way.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn494" id="fnanc494">494</a></p>

<p>Kings and emperors came with the rest; first of all,
the cause of the tragedy, Henry II, who, to avoid excommunication,
after a first penance at Avranches, in the course
of which he had promised to go on a pilgrimage, at the
Pope’s choice, to Rome, Jerusalem, or St. James’s,
appeared for a severer test at the shrine of his dead enemy,
on July 12, 1174. Walking the streets barefoot, dressed
in haircloth and a woollen shirt, looking a “mendif”
(beggar), having fasted for days on bread and water, the
bells in the minster tolling a funeral knell,
he kissed the <span class="xxpn" id="p353">{353}</span>
pavement of the cathedral at the place where Thomas
had fallen. Led, then, to the crypt, the proud Plantagenet,
the ruler of England and of half of France, conqueror of
Ireland, suzerain of Scotland, was flogged on his bare
shoulders by the prelates present, beginning with Gilbert
Foliot, Bishop of London:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Li
 evesques de Lundres tint el puing le balai.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Thus, “beaten and punished,” he spent the night,
on the cold pavement, “in psalms and orisons,” before
the tomb, and gave to the sister of the saint a mill, well
worth ten marks of revenue—</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Bien
valt dis mars par an la rente qu’ele en a.”<a
class="afnanc" href="#fn495" id="fnanc495">495</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>Henry’s rival and suzerain, the King of France, the
former crusader, brave, pious and inefficient Louis VII,
came shortly after; a prodigious and unparalleled event,
the first time a king of France had ever set foot on British
soil. Feeling that for him death was near, and having
had, although three times married, only one son, he decided
in 1179 to have the young prince crowned at once, but
before the ceremony, Philip, aged fourteen, while boar
hunting, lost his way in the forest of Compiègne, and,
separated from his companions, endured for days such
hardships before a charcoal-burner found him and led
him out of the maze that his life was despaired of. The
king, in his anguish, had at night a vision of St. Thomas
Becket, whom he had well known, promising life for his
son if he himself went to Canterbury as a pilgrim. Louis’s
advisers recommended not to risk a journey which would
place him at the mercy of his enemy, the Plantagenet
king. But again, and yet again, St. Thomas appeared
at night, now threatening disaster. Louis started then
with a brilliant retinue, and no untoward event marred
the journey. Henry II, on the
contrary, very meek <span class="xxpn" id="p354">{354}</span>
now when his former chancellor was in question, came
to meet the French monarch at Dover; both went
together to Canterbury; Louis remained two days in
prayer, and offered the monks a gold cup and a
magnificent gem shown henceforth to pilgrims as the
“regale of France.” By a special charter he granted
them, besides, one hundred casks of wine to be taken
yearly for ever, at vintage time, from his cellars of
Poissy-sur-Seine.</p>

<p>He returned to find his son on the way to recovery;
and, having had him crowned, died within a year. The
son, one of whose first acts was to confirm his father’s
hundred casks’ charter, was that famous Philip August
whose victory at Bouvines, in 1214, settled the fate of
France and made it certain that she would be a great nation.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn496" id="fnanc496">496</a></p>

<p>It became henceforth a sort of tradition for British
kings to make this pilgrimage. Back from Palestine
and his Austrian prison, Richard Cœur-de-Lion went,
on his return, to Canterbury out of gratitude for his
recovered freedom. When king in his turn, his brother,
John, went too; so did Henry III, Edward I, and nearly
all English monarchs; so did the French king, John
the Good, when a prisoner in England<a class="afnanc" href="#fn497" id="fnanc497">497</a>;
so did, in <span class="xxpn" id="p355">{355}</span>
December 1400, Manuel II, Palæologus, emperor of
Constantinople<a class="afnanc" href="#fn498" id="fnanc498">498</a>; so did, in 1416, Emperor Sigismund,
grandson of the blind King Jean de Luxembourg, who
had been killed at Crécy, himself then the dominant
figure in Europe, a quick-witted and, for the time, liberal-minded
sovereign, who, present one day in the Paris
Parliament, when justice was being rendered, and seeing
a plebeian about to lose his suit simply because he was
a plebeian, rose from his seat, and, to the wonder of the
assembly, touching him with his sword, made him a
knight. A remarkable man was that Canterbury pilgrim,
as a man as well as an emperor.</p>

<p>Accompanied by another emperor, Charles V, King
Henry VIII came too, but having changed his mind later
about a great many matters, he ordered every shrine
to be destroyed, showing especial vindictiveness towards
all that recalled Thomas Becket. If alive, he thought,
the archbishop would have probably been, just as the
recently beheaded More and Fisher, opposed to the new
dogma of the royal supremacy: most probably, indeed.
No mercy should therefore be shown to his bones and
to that shrine, where Henry must have seen in former
days a silver image of his own father bequeathed to be
placed as near the tomb as it could possibly be. The
monument was razed with particular care, and the long
venerated bones scattered. Having appointed himself
Head of the Church, Henry considered that he was free
to undo what another Head of the Church, a Pope of
long ago, had done, and, if it so pleased him, to un-canonize
a saint. While, therefore, allowing many other British
saints to remain on the calendar, he issued in 1539 “certain
injunctions,” in which, after
having informed his <span class="xxpn" id="p356">{356}</span>
priests that if they continued to marry he would send
them to jail, he reviewed the life of Becket, showed to his
own satisfaction that he was no saint, but rather “a
rebel and a traitor to his prince,” that “he gave opprobious
names to the gentlemen which then counselled him
to leave his stubornness,” that a scuffle ensued with these
“gentlemen,” and so “in the throng Becket was slain.”</p>

<p>The King, therefore, commands English people to
cease calling the most famous of all the saints they had a
saint, “and that his images, and pictures, through the
whole realm .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. be plucked down .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to the intent
his grace’s loving subjects shall be no longer blindly
lead and abused to commit idolatry”; if they persist,
they will go to jail, “at his grace’s pleasure.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn499" id="fnanc499">499</a>
In the
same way had they been recommended shortly before
not to call this one, or that one, of their loving sovereign’s
daughters legitimate, so long as he himself chose to call
them bastards; there was a gradation in the penalties,
and in the case of the daughters it was death.</p>

<p>Equally inimical dispositions were shown during
the next reign by Archbishop Cranmer towards his
predecessor, and one of the articles of his “Visitation
to be had within the diocese of Canterbury” had for its
object to ascertain “whether they have put out of their
church books this word Papa and the name and service
of Thomas Becket.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn500" id="fnanc500">500</a></p>

<p>Times had changed. But,</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">

<h4>III</h4>

<p>In those holy journeys, as in Chaucer’s book, all
ranks of society were mingled together. The majority
of these pilgrims were sincere and in good faith; they
had made a vow and came to fulfil it. With such dispositions,
the knight who found a pilgrim like himself
upon the road would not be inclined to keep haughtily
aloof; besides, if the distances were great between class
and class at this period, familiarity was still greater. The
distance has indeed diminished at the present day, and
familiarity also, as though in compensation. The noble
felt himself sufficiently raised above the common people
not to be afraid of using a kind of jovial intimacy with
them on occasion; at the present time, when superiority
of rank is of less importance, many are more attentive
and take care not to overstep a limit which is not now so
patent as before.</p>

<p>Arrived at the end of the journey, all prayed; prayed
with fervour in the humblest posture. The soul was
filled with religious emotion when from the end of the
majestic alley formed by the great pillars of the church,
through the coloured twilight of the nave, the heart
divined, rather than the eye saw, the mysterious object
of veneration for which such a distance had been traversed
at the cost of such fatigue. Though the practical man
galloping up to bargain with the saint for the favour of
God, though the emissary sent to make offering in the
name of his master might keep a dry and
clear eye, tears <span class="xxpn" id="p358">{358}</span>
coursed down the cheeks of the poor and simple in heart;
he tasted fully of the pious emotion he had come to seek,
the peace of heaven descended into his bosom, and he
went away consoled.</p>

<p>Such was the happy lot of humble devout souls. Pilgrims,
however, were undoubtedly a very mixed race;
no reader of Chaucer needs to be reminded that the talk
on the way was not limited to edifying subjects, and
that pilgrims themselves, even allowing the greater number
to have been sincere, were not all of them vessels of
election. Some went like gypsies to a fair and tried to
gather money by begging; some went for the pleasures
of the journey and the merriments of the road; so that
reformers and satirists, paying more attention to the
abuse than to the less visible good that came along with
it, began to raise a cry which grew louder and louder
until, at the time of the Reformation, it was something
like a storm. Whom did Langland see on Palmers’
way, near Walsingham? Those same false hermits we
have already met by the highroads and at the corner of
bridges, and in what objectionable company!</p>

</div></div>

<p>Wyclif denounced pilgrimages most persistently, so
much so that, when later some of his followers had to
renounce their heresies, belief in the usefulness and sanctity
of pilgrimages was one of the articles they had to subscribe.
Thus, in his vow of abjuration, the Lollard William
Dynet of Nottingham, on December 1, 1395, swears in
these words: “Fro this day forthwarde I shall worshipe
ymages, with praying and offering unto
hem, in the <span class="xxpn" id="p359">{359}</span>
worschepe of the seintes that they be made after; and
also I shal nevermore despyse pylgremage.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn502" id="fnanc502">502</a></p>

<p>But other Lollards refused to recant. Questioned
by Archbishop Arundel the irreconcilable enemy of his
sect, William Thorpe confesses in 1407 having preached
against that passion “to seek and visit the bones or images
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of this saint and of that,” so uncontrollable that,
“ofttimes divers men and women of these runners thus
madly hither and thither into pilgrimage, borrow hereto
other men’s goods (yea, and sometimes they steal men’s
goods hereto), and they pay them never again.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn503" id="fnanc503">503</a></p>

<p>For “divers men and women” those journeys being
chiefly pleasure trips, nothing, Thorpe continues, is forgotten
that may make them more pleasurable, “and finding out one
pilgrimage, they will ordain beforehand to have with them
both men and women that can well sing wanton songs; and
some other pilgrims will have with them bagpipes: so
that every town they come through, what with the noise
of their singing, and with the sound of their piping, and
with the jangling of their Canterbury bells, and with the
barking out of dogs after them, they make more noise
than if the king came there away, with all his clarions
and many other minstrels.”</p>

<p>Chaucer’s pilgrims had not, perhaps, quite so magnificent
a record, and when they crossed Dartford or Rochester
did not outnoise the king himself; they had, in any case,
no women singers; but their miller was provided with
a sonorous bagpipe:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>A
baggepype wel coude he blowe and sowne,</div>
<div class="dpp00">And ther-with-al he broghte us out of towne.”</div>
</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">Their monk’s bridle was heard jingling
“as loude as <span class="xxpn" id="p360">{360}</span>
dooth the chapel-belle”; they talked boisterously, wrangled,
and made merry,</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>For
 trewely, confort ne mirthe is noon</div>
<div class="dpp00">To ryde by the weye doumb as a stoon,”</div>
</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">and dogs, of course, did not remain “doumb” for them
any more than for the king.</p>

<p>One more objection of Thorpe’s to those journeys
was that, “if these men and women be a month out in
their pilgrimage, many of them shall be, a half-year after,
great janglers, tale-tellers, and liars.” Chaucer’s pilgrims
were certainly, in their way, and no one nowadays objects,
great “tale-tellers.”</p>

<p>Archbishop Arundel, who seems at times to be the
one interrogated (but we must not forget that we have
only Thorpe’s version, unrevised by the other party),
makes a more picturesque than telling answer: “Lewd
losell! thou seest not far enough in this matter! for
thou considerest not the great travail of pilgrims. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I say to thee that it is right well done, that pilgrims have
with them both singers and also pipers: that when one
of them that goeth barefoot striketh his toe upon a stone,
and hurteth him sore and maketh him to bleed, it is well
done that he or his fellow begin then a song or else take
out of his bosom a bagpipe to drive away with such mirth
the hurt of his fellow.”</p>

<p>Lay writers of a reforming mind objected to pilgrimages,
not so much on account of the worship of images,
but because they thought these travels an encouragement
to laziness and idle living. We know the opinion of
Langland. The same views are expressed by an author
of a quite different turn of mind, the one who wrote the
“Roman de Renart,” and who has a special chapter to inform
us “of the pilgrimage of Reynard and how he went to
Rome.” Reynard cannot but consider that
he has greatly <span class="xxpn" id="p361">{361}</span>
and many a time sinned, and feeling some anxiety about
his misdeeds, goes to a hermit and confesses himself.
Such are the faults he has to declare that the holy man
does not dare absolve him, but advises him to go to Rome
and ask the absolution of the Pope. Reynard accordingly
“takes his scrip and burdon [that is, his wallet and staff,
as did all pilgrims], and begins to move on, and takes
his way; he looks quite like a pilgrim, his scrip fits his
neck beautifully.” But travelling alone is not pleasant;
he meets Belin the Sheep, and persuades him to come
with him, and a little farther “Bernart the arch-priest,”
a donkey, who was eating thistles in a ditch; he also
secures this new companion.</p>

<p>As night is coming, the three, finding themselves near
the house of Primaut the Wolf, enter without ceremony
and make themselves at home, while the owner of the
place is away. They find there “salted meat, cheese,
and eggs .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and good ale. Belin drinks so much
that he loses his head, and then begins to sing, and the
arch-priest to organ-bray, and Master Reynard sings in
falsetto.” But their merriment is soon at an end. The
alarm has been given; Ysengrin, Hersent, and a number
of other wolves, relations, friends, compeers of Primaut,
who all of them owe grudges to Reynard, come round
and besiege the pilgrims. They escape with great
difficulty. Ill-pleased with these grievous adventures,
they agree not to go to Rome at all, and Reynard, to
whom, rather against likelihood, the author here lends
his own thoughts, winds up the enterprise with a speech:
“&#x200a;‘My lords,’ says he, ‘by my head, this wandering is
loathsome and tiring. There is in the world many a
good man that has never been to Rome; such an one
has come back from the Seven Saints who is worse than
he ever was. I mean to take my way home, and I shall
live by my labour and seek honest earnings; I shall be
charitable to poor people.’ Then they cried,
‘Be it so, <span class="xxpn" id="p362">{362}</span>
be it so,’ and they betook themselves homewards,” converts
to better lives, for a time.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn504" id="fnanc504">504</a></p>

<p>The same mode of reasoning was used later on, at the
time of the Renaissance, by no less a man than Erasmus,
who has described in his most satirical vein the vanities
of pilgrims and pilgrimages. He supposes a meeting
of two friends, Menedemus and Ogygyus, the latter just
back from Compostela, and, what is more interesting
for us, from Walsingham, “the most holy name in all
England. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The towne is almost susteynyd by the
resort of pylgrymes.” The faithful believer Ogygyus
goes on describing the wonders of the place, the gold and
silver and precious stones offered to the miraculous statue
of our Lady, the marvels worked at the holy wells, the
miracle of the knight towards whom the portal of the
church stretched out, the beautiful relics, and especially
the crystal phial containing the Virgin’s milk. “Whan
ye sexten sawe us, he dyd runne to the aultre, and put
apon hym his surplese and his stole about his nekke,
knelyd downe relygyously and worshipyd it, and streghtforthe
dyd offre the mylke to us to kysse.” The same
ceremony with surplice and kneeling, though it has disappeared
at Walsingham with the phial itself, may still
be seen elsewhere any day, in Milan, for example, at the
tomb of San Carlo Borromeo.</p>

<p>Ogygyus and his friends make their offerings, not
without remarking that some unscrupulous visitors, by
a clever trick, pick money out of the plate instead of
leaving in it any of their own: a trick which, as we
have seen, was used by Panurge on a certain day when
he was somewhat “escorné et taciturne” for lack of
pence.</p>

<p>Erasmus ends his dialogue in the same strain
as the author of “Reynard”: <span class="xxpn"
id="p363">{363}</span></p>

<p>“I have enough to do,” says sceptical Menedemus, “with
my statyons of Rome.</p>

<p>“<span class="spspeaker">Ogygyus.</span> Of Rome, that
dyd never see Rome?</p>

<p>“<span class="spspeaker">Menedemus.</span> I wyll
tell you, thus I go my statyons at home. I go in to the
parler, and I se unto the chast lyvynge of my doughters;
agayne frome thense I go in to my shope, I beholde what my
servauntes, bothe men and women, be doynge. From thense
into the kytchyn, lokynge abowt, if ther nede any of my
cownsell; frome thense hyther and thyther, observynge howe
my chylderne be occupyed, what my wyffe dothe, beynge
carefull that every thynge be in ordre: these be statyons
of Rome.</p>

<p>“<span class="spspeaker">Ogygyus.</span> But these
thynges saynt James wold dow for yow.</p>

<p>“<span class="spspeaker">Menedemus.</span> That I
shuld se unto these thynges holy Scripture commaundethe;
that I shuld commyt the charge to sayntes I dyd rede
yt never commaunded.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn505"
id="fnanc505">505</a></p>

<p>Thus far Menedemus, whose task in life seems to
have consisted in seeing to it that others fulfilled theirs.
The friend of Erasmus, Sir Thomas More, took the
opposite view, and wrote a dialogue in defence of images,
relics, and pilgrimages, but in vain.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn506" id="fnanc506">506</a>
The time of the
Reformation had come; doubt was becoming general,
and from peasant to baron all the people assimilated
arguments like those of Latimer:</p>

<p>“What thinke ye of these images that are had more
then their felowes in reputation? that are gone unto
with such labour and werines of
the body, frequented <span class="xxpn" id="p364">{364}</span>
with such our cost, sought out and visited with such
confidence? what say ye by these images, that are so
famous, so noble, so noted, beying of them so many and
so divers in England. Do you thinke that this preferryng
of picture to picture, image to image, is the right use,
and not rather the abuse of images?”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn507" id="fnanc507">507</a></p>

<p>These times were yet to be. In the Middle Ages
pilgrims came to offer their prayers, and also money,
each one according to his means. When the king, in
his perpetual goings and comings, turned aside to visit
a revered shrine, he usually gave seven shillings, as shown
by the ordinances of Edward II for his household.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn508" id="fnanc508">508</a></p>

<p>Before going away the pilgrims, who had admired,
besides the shrine and its jewels, the stained glass of the
church, the monumental curiosities of the place and sometimes
its fortifications,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn509" id="fnanc509">509</a>
bought, just as now, medals or
signs as remembrances of their journey.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn510" id="fnanc510">510</a>
The author
of the supplement to the “Canterbury Tales” at the
beginning of the fifteenth century, shows the pilgrims
purchasing in the town various sorts of <i>sygnys</i>
or <i>brochis</i>, so <span class="xxpn" id="p365">{365}</span>
that people who saw them might know where they had
been:</p>

<div class="dpoemfarlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Then,
 as manere and custom is, signes there they boughte,</div>
<div class="dpp00">Ffor men of contre shulde know whom
they hadde [s]oughte.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn511"
id="fnanc511">511</a></div>
</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">They were of lead or pewter, and
perforated to be more easily sewn on the breast or cap,
like those sold at the present day at St. Anne d’Auray
in Brittany, but larger. At Canterbury they represented
St. Thomas, or were in the shape of an ampulla or tiny
flask, containing water from the miraculous well; at St.
James’s they represented shells; at Amiens the head of
St. John the Baptist: “Ecce signum faciei beati Johannis
Baptiste”; at Rome the holy sudary, called the vernicle;<a
class="afnanc" href="#fn512" id="fnanc512">512</a> at
Rocamadour the Holy Virgin.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn513"
id="fnanc513">513</a> The right of selling these signs was
a source of profit, and it sometimes belonged exclusively
to a convent or to a private family. At Rocamadour this
<span class="xxpn" id="p366">{366}</span> right had been
conceded in return, it seems, for military services, to
the De Valon family, lords of Thegra.<a class="afnanc"
href="#fn514" id="fnanc514">514</a> They and the Bishop of
Tulle appointed a deputy to superintend the sale, and the
product was divided by halves between them and the bishop.
Such were the benefits derived from these sales that
clandestine manufactories of pewter medals were established
by the inhabitants, who sold numbers of them, to the
great detriment of the authorized shop and in defiance
of ever-recurring prohibitions. Once, however, in 1425,
free sale was allowed to all the people of the place; the
country had been reduced to such poverty that the bishop
renounced his privilege for two years, out of charity and
for the benefit of his flock.</p>

<p>Pilgrims when going home were careful to wear
prominently sewn on their garments these testimonials of
their holy travels. In the above-quoted dialogue of
Erasmus, the sceptical Menedemus wonders at the appearance
of his friend: “I pray you, what araye is this that you
be in; me thynke that you be clothyd with cockle schelles,
and be laden on every side with bruches of lead and tynne.
And you be pretely garnyshed with wrethes of strawe, and
your arme is full of snakes eggs,” thus uncivilly designating
the beads of his chaplet. The French king Louis XI, of
grim memory, was never without some such pewter medals
and brooches, and wore them on his hat. “And truly,”
writes his contemporary, Claude de Seyssel, “his devotion
seemed more superstitious than religious. For to whatever
image or church of God and the saints or of Our Lady that
he heard the people were devoted, or where miracles were
worked, he went there to make offerings, or sent a man
there expressly. He had, besides, his hat quite full of
images, mostly of lead or pewter, which he kissed on all
occasions when any good or bad news arrived, or that his
fancy prompted him; casting himself upon
his knees so <span class="xxpn" id="p367">{367}</span>
suddenly at times, in whatever place he might be, that he
seemed more like one wounded in his understanding
than a rational man.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn515" id="fnanc515">515</a></p>

<p>Professional pilgrims outshone in this respect all the
others. For, beside the occasional pilgrim who came to
make an offering to such or such a shrine in accomplishment
of a vow and afterwards returned to take up again
the course of his ordinary life, there was the pilgrim by
calling or by penance (for such a life-long penance was
sometimes inflicted), whose whole existence was spent
travelling from one sanctuary to another, always on the
road, and always begging. With the professional
pardoner, the professional palmer, back from many countries,
adorned with many tokens, the witness of many
wonders, the hero of many adventures, was the most
curious type of the religious wayfaring race, with hardly
any equivalent in our days. Like the pardoner and the
friar, the palmer could not but have a great experience
of men and things; he had seen much, and he invented
more. He too had to edify the multitude to whom he
held out his hand for alms, and the fine stories, in which
he rarely missed giving himself a part to play, were his
livelihood; failing this, his daily bread failed too. By
dint of repeating his tales, he came to almost believing
them, then quite; and his voice henceforth took that
accent of certitude which alone begets conviction in
audiences. Besides, he came from so far that he might
indeed have seen marvels; around us, of course, life flows
on without prodigies, almost without events in its flat
monotony; but it is common knowledge that in distant
parts things are quite different. And the best proof is
that none of those who have undertaken the journey
comes back disappointed, quite
the contrary; the <span class="xxpn" id="p368">{368}</span>
pleasure of believing them is moreover innocent enough,
why should we deprive ourselves of an enjoyment
exhilarating for the mind and good for the soul?</p>

<p>Clever people, poets, men of the world, deprived
themselves of this pleasure, and made up for the loss by
laughing at pilgrims and story-telling travellers. So did
Chaucer, as we have already seen, who held up to ridicule
in his “House of Fame,” shipmen and pilgrims, with their
bags “brimful of lies.” To the same effect but in graver
mood, Langland wrote in his “Visions”:</p>

<div class="dpoemfarlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Pylgrimis
 and palmers · plyghten hem to-gederes,</div>
<div class="dpp00">To seche saint Iame · and seyntys of rome,</div>
<div class="dpp00">Wenten forth in hure (their) way · with

<div class="dpp00">And haven leve to lye · al
hure lyf-tyme.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn516"
id="fnanc516">516</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>The crowd felt otherwise; they listened, laughed
per­haps some­times, but more often recol­lect­ed
them­selves and re­mained at­ten­tive. The pil­grim was so
inter­est­ing! he was a play in him­self, a living story,
he had on his feet the dust of Rome and of Jerusalem, and
brought news of the “wor­ship­pers” of Mahomet. He was a
picture too, with his bag hung at his side, not for lies,
but for provisions, and his staff, at the top of which was
a knob and sometimes a piece of metal with an ap­prop­riate
motto like the device on a bronze ring found at Hitchin, a
cross with these words, “Hæc in tute dirigat iter” (“May
this safely guide thee on thy way”).<a class="afnanc"
href="#fn517" id="fnanc517">517</a> The staff had at the
other end an iron point, like an alpen­stock of the <span
class="xxpn" id="p369">{369}</span> present day; as may be
seen in numerous drawings in mediæval manuscripts.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The whole race of wanderers was, however, as we know,
looked at askance by the king’s officers; these goings
and comings disquieted the sheriff. We have already met
labourers who, weary of their lord, left him under pretext
of distant pilgrimages, and laid down without scruple the
pilgrim’s staff at the door of a new master who would pay
them better. False pilgrims were not less numerous than
false pardoners and false hermits; they were condemned to
repose, under pain of imprisonment, by the same statutes
as the beggars and wandering workmen. Henceforward,
orders Richard II in 1388, they too must have permits
with a special seal affixed by certain worthy men.<a
class="afnanc" href="#fn518" id="fnanc518">518</a> Those
without a permit should be forthwith arrested, unless
infirm and incapable of work, for their good faith is then
evident, and it is not for the love of vagabondage that
they painfully go and visit “optimum ægrorum medicum,”
Saint Thomas. Even greater severity was shown when it was
a matter of <span class="xxpn" id="p370">{370}</span>
crossing the sea; would-be pilgrims must be furnished
with regular passports; and the law applied to “all
manner of people, as well clerks as other,” under pain of
confiscation of all their goods. The exceptions made by
the king show besides that it is wanderers of doubtful
status and motives whom he has in view, for there are
dispensations for the “lords and other great persons of the
realm,” for the “true and notable merchants,” and lastly,
for the “king’s soldiers.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn519"
id="fnanc519">519</a></p>

<p>This passport or “licence,” this “special leave of
the king,” could only be available at certain ports, namely,
London, Sandwich, Dover, Southampton, Plymouth,
Dartmouth, Bristol, Yarmouth, Boston, Kingston-upon-Hull,
Newcastle-upon-Tyne, and the ports of the coast
facing Ireland. Heavy penalties were laid on all port
wardens, inspectors, ship captains, etc., who were neglectful,
or so bold as to show favour to roamers. In the year
1389, the king restrained pilgrims from embarking anywhere
else than at Dover or Plymouth. To put to sea
elsewhere, an “especial licence from the king himself”
was necessary.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn520" id="fnanc520">520</a>
A number of such licences, as will be
seen further, are still in existence.</p>

<div class="section">
<h4>IV</h4>

<p>But the attraction of distant pilgrimages was great,<a
class="afnanc" href="#fn521" id="fnanc521">521</a>
especially the three without equal: Rome, Jerusalem, and
St. James’s of Galicia, held so sacred that, while most
<span class="xxpn" id="p371">{371}</span> of the vows
taken by the benefactors of the great bridge at Avignon
could be remitted on account of their gifts to this useful
structure, exception was made if the question was of a
pilgrimage to be performed to one of those three places.<a
class="afnanc" href="#fn522" id="fnanc522">522</a> With or
without letters men crossed the Channel, for which they
paid sixpence, or if they had a horse, two shillings.<a
class="afnanc" href="#fn523" id="fnanc523">523</a>
They arrived at Calais, stopping there some time in a
“Maison-Dieu,” or hospital, which had been built and
endowed by pious souls with revenues “for the sustenance
of the pilgrims and other poor folks repairing to the
said town to rest and refresh them.”<a class="afnanc"
href="#fn524" id="fnanc524">524</a></p>

<p>Setting out again, they went to Boulogne to pray to a
miraculous virgin, whose hand still exists enclosed in a
reliquary. The statue itself was thrown into a well by
the Protestants in 1567, replaced on the altar in 1630,
pulled down again at the Revolution and burnt, but
one of the faithful saved the hand, which the church of
Notre Dame preserves to this day. Chaucer’s travelled
gossip, the Wife of Bath, had among other pilgrimages,
made this one to Boulogne.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn525" id="fnanc525">525</a>
People also went to Amiens
to venerate the head, or rather one of the heads, of St.
John the Baptist.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn526" id="fnanc526">526</a>
Great was their
wonder when, <span class="xxpn" id="p372">{372}</span>
continuing their journey, they fell in with another at Constantinople.
Perhaps, let us hope, they were content with
remarking as “Mandeville” does: Which is the true
one? “I wot nere, but God knowethe; but in what
wyse than men worschipen it, the blessed seynt John holt
him a-payd.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn527" id="fnanc527">527</a>
Then also people went to the shrine of
the three kings at Cologne, to Paris where innumerable
relics were kept, to Chartres, where, besides a famous statue
of the Virgin, was shown the tunic she wore on the day of
the Annunciation (preserved in the cathedral since 861),<a class="afnanc" href="#fn528" id="fnanc528">528</a>
to Vezelay, Tours, Le Puy, and to many other places in
France, among which the celebrated and to the present day
most frequented church of Our Lady of Rocamadour in
Guyenne. The fame of this pilgrimage among Englishmen
is attested by Langland, when he advises people
belonging to the religious orders to cease pilgrimage-making,
and rather practice virtue at home:</p>

<div class="dpoemfarlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Right

class="afnanc" href="#fn529" id="fnanc529">529</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>It was a shrine of great renown. Roland, according to
a legend, went there before starting for the ill-fated
expedition in which he met his death, and a large piece of
rusted iron is still shown in the old church as part of the
famous Durandal. Henry II of England came there, too, as a
pilgrim, as did many other illustrious travellers, Simon
de Montfort among them.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn530"
id="fnanc530">530</a> The place was fortified; it had a
part to play in the Hundred Years’ War, <span class="xxpn"
id="p375">{375}</span> and Froissart has told us “howe

<p>Then there were Spanish pilgrimages, and especially the
world-famous one at Compostela, where English travellers
went in large numbers, most of them direct by sea, though
some preferred the lengthy, picturesque land road, dotted
with famous shrines good for the soul, and where all
sorts of adventures might be expected.<a class="afnanc"
href="#fn532" id="fnanc532">532</a> Licences authorizing
the owners and the captain of such or such a ship to carry
to St. James’s a fixed number of pilgrims fill pages
in Rymer’s “Fœdera.” They were granted pursuant to the
before-mentioned statute of Richard II, and are all drawn
after one or two models, the text in Latin, with the name
of the ship in French, like the one here translated, of the
year 1394:</p>

<p>“The king, to all and each of his Admirals, etc.,
greeting.</p>

<p>“Know you that we have given licence to Oto Chambernoun,
William Gilbert, and Richard Gilbert, to receive and
em­bark in the harbour of Dartmouth a hundred pilgrims in
a cer­tain ship be­long­ing to the same Oto, William, and
Richard, called la Charité de Payn­ton, of which Peter Cok
is captain; and to take them to Saint James’s, there to
ful­fil their vows, and from thence to bring them back to
England, freely and without hind­rance, not­with­stand­ing
any or­di­nances to the con­trary.”<a class="afnanc"
href="#fn533" id="fnanc533">533</a> <span class="xxpn"
id="p376">{376}</span></p>

<p>A few provisos are added, the keeping of which the
pilgrims should swear to before leaving England; they
must upon their oath bind themselves to do nothing
contrary to the obedience and fealty they owe the king;
they must not take out of the realm gold or silver in money
or bullion beyond what is necessary to their journey,
and they must not, it is sometimes added, reveal the secrets
of the kingdom.</p>

<p>During the following century these licences became
innumerable, or maybe they have been preserved in larger
numbers. They show that, in fact, fleets loaded with
English pilgrims plied towards St. James’s. We find
that “Le Petre de Darthmouth” is allowed to carry sixty
pilgrims; “La Marie de Southampton,” a hundred; “La Sainte
Marie de Blakney,” sixty; “Le Garlond de Crowemere,”
sixty; “La Trinité de Wells,” forty; “Le Thomas de
Saltash,” sixty; and so on. Numbers usually vary from
thirty to one hundred.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn534"

<p id="p378">It must not be thought that these ships,
carrying as much as a hundred passengers besides their crew
on this rather long journey, were great, well-appointed
vessels. They very much resembled the pilgrim-ships of the
present day, which carry every year to Jeddah, on the Red
Sea, crowds of Arabs on their way to Mecca. The travellers
were huddled together in most uncomfortable fashion, and
had ample opportunities to do penance and offer their
sufferings to the saint. This is no surmise, for one of
those English pilgrims duly allowed to go to Galicia,
provided they did not reveal the secrets of the realm,
has rimed an account of his experiences, so we know what
they were. Do not think of laughing, says he, when you go
by sea to St. James’s; there is sea-sickness; the sailors
push you about under pretext that you hinder the working
of the ship; the smell is not pleasant: <span class="xxpn"

<p>Votive offerings plentifully adorned venerated
sanctuaries; if, by striking a wax statuette while making
appropriate incantations an enemy might do you great harm,
on the other hand, by placing your image in the chapel of
a saint, great favours might be gained for you, especially
in cases of sickness.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn536"

</div></div>

<p>Another story to the same effect is told by Miélot,
who reports how a very fair lady, who had led an ill life,
lost her sight as a punishment, through the will of Heaven.
She went on a pilgrimage to Rocamadour, prayed to the
Virgin, and was healed, but could not, however, enter the
sanctuaries. She then confessed on the spot to a priest,
who, “looking at her fair face,” said: “Dear friend, I
well know that with these fair tresses of your hair you
have done great hurt to those to whom you have shown
them. I decide that they must be cut off in honour of
God and of our Lady.” This was done; “the tresses
were cut, and the priest had them carried inside the
church on a pole, on which were placed the tresses of
women who would be saved.” Then the lady was able
to enter the church, and she praised the Virgin. But as
she was going away she could not help thinking “of her
fair hair that she had left,” and she exclaimed: “Holy
Mary, my heart is sorrowful for my hair that I leave
you, and I cannot well make up my mind to it.” She
had scarcely spoken when the tresses were at once restored
to her “as fair as they were before;” but the blindness
came back too, and blind she remained for ever, which is
a good example, “ung bel exemplaire,” for ladies that
“seek false pleasures in their fine waists and faces.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn539" id="fnanc539">539</a></p>

<p>Indulgences were an immense
attraction; they had <span class="xxpn" id="p384">{384}</span>
been freely granted on a large scale to every important
shrine, and popular imagination still further
magnified them. The pilgrim from Rome, back in his
village, exaggerated as willingly their amount as that of
the marvels which he had seen, or thought he had seen.
One such pilgrim, an Englishman of the fourteenth
century, dazzled by his recollections, has rimed his impressions
of a journey taken by him to Italy. As a poet
he does not rank high, but he does not pretend to, and his
only aim is to supply precise figures and definite information.
His strong narrow devotion allowed him to pay
attention to nothing except thousands of bodies of martyrs
that he never tires of enumerating. By thousands also
are reckoned the years of indulgence which he flashes
in the eyes of his stay-at-home countrymen:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Gif
 men wuste (knew), grete and smale,</div>
<div class="dpp00">The pardoun that is at grete Rome,</div>
<div class="dpp00">Thei wolde tellen in heore dome (in their opinion),</div>
<div class="dpp00">Hit were no neod to mon in cristiante</div>
<div class="dpp00">To passe in to the holy lond over the see</div>
<div class="dpp00">To Jerusalem, ne to Kateryne.”<a
class="afnanc" href="#fn540" id="fnanc540">540</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>His readers will have first a brief and simplified
history of Rome; it is a city to which came long ago the
Duchess of Troy with her two sons, Romulus and Romulon,
who afterwards founded the town. The duchess
thus seems to have chosen to settle in a city which did
not yet exist, but Rome is a land of wonders. It was
pagan, until Peter and Paul (and then the very facts
inject their eloquence into our traveller’s lines):</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dpp06">“Hit
 hedde i-bought,</div>
<div class="dpp00">With gold ne selver, ne with no goode,</div>
<div class="dpp00">Bot with heore flesch and with heore blode.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>The enumeration of the churches thereupon begins,
and for each of them are invariably told
the amount of <span class="xxpn" id="p385">{385}</span>
indulgences attached to it and of relics kept there. The
benefits are proportioned to the merits; thus when a
man sees the <i>vernicle</i>, that is, the holy sudary which
received the image of the Saviour, he gets three thousand
years of pardon if he dwells in Rome, nine thousand if
he comes from a neighbouring country,</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>And
 thou that passest over the see,</div>
<div class="dpp00">Twelve thousend yer is graunted to the.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>When you enter Sts. Vitus and Modestus, the third
of your sins are remitted. Then, you descend into the
catacombs:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>But

<div class="dpp00">And suffrede peynes harde and sore,</div>
<div class="dpp00">In hevene to dwelle for ever more.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>The bodies of martyrs are countless;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn541" id="fnanc541">541</a>
four thousand
of them at Saint Prudence, thirteen hundred at Saint
Prassede, seven thousand at Sts. Vitus and Modestus.
From time to time a famous name brings up an historic
glimpse, such as the account of the foundation of Rome,
or an abridged life of Constantine; at first a pagan and
a leper,</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>In
 Mahoun was al his thouht.”</div>
</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue" id="p386">But according to our
author’s information, he was converted and cured by Pope
Sylvester. The church of St. Mary the Round formerly bore
another name:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Agrippa
 dude hit make</div>
<div class="dpp00">For Sibyl and Neptanes sake.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</div>
<div class="dpp00">He gaf hit name Panteon.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>He placed there a magnificent golden idol sitting, of
a peculiar form:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Hit
 looked forth as a cat,</div>
<div class="dpp00">He called it Neptan.”</div>
</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">This idol had a cap or cover of brass which was one day
blown off by the wind, and carried to the church of St.
Peter. Then Pope Boniface asked the Emperor Julian
to give him the Pantheon, to which that prince consented;
and one year, on November 1st, the hatless cat having
been removed, the sovereign pontiff consecrated the
building, and baptized it St. Mary the Round.</p>

<p>As for relics, there are few objects mentioned in
Holy Writ which have not been recovered, and may not
be venerated at Rome.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn542" id="fnanc542">542</a>
The table of the Last Supper is
there, as well as Aaron’s rod, fragments of the multiplied
loaves and fishes, hay from the stall at Bethlehem, a
swaddling-cloth of the infant Jesus, and several other
things, some of which are strange enough. Part of these
relics are still in the same churches, for instance, at Santa
Maria Maggiore,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn543" id="fnanc543">543</a>
“Seinte Marie the
Maiour,” the portrait <span class="xxpn" id="p387">{387}</span>
of the Virgin painted by St. Luke. This is not, however,
according to our pilgrim, a picture really made by St.
Luke; he was going to do it, and had prepared his
colours, when he suddenly found the portrait before him,
finished by the hands of angels:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Seint

class="afnanc" href="#fn544" id="fnanc544">544</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>More complete and conscientious in his descriptions, an
educated Englishman of the following century, a voracious
reader, and active writer, of books, no other than the
chronicler and theologian, John Capgrave, prior of King’s
Lynn, having gone to Rome on a pilgrimage, about the year
1450, composed, on his return, a “Solace of Pilgrimes,”
wanting to imitate, he said, Pythagoras, Plato, St. Jerome,
Marco Polo, and him whom he considered as his compatriot,
the then unmasked Mandeville, who, all of them, having
travelled, wrote of their journeys: <span class="xxpn"
id="p388">{388}</span> “Also there was a man of
Venys whech they called Marcus Paulus; he laboured all the
Soudane’s londe and descryved on to us the nature of the
cuntre, the condiciones of the men and the stately aray of
the great Cane (khan) houshold. Eke Jon Maundevyle Knyth
of Yngland, aftir his laboure, made a book ful solacious
on to his nacyoun. After all these grete cryeris of many
wonderfull thingis I wyl folow with a smal pypyng of such
straunge sitis (sights) as I have seyn and swech straunge
thingis as I have herd.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn545"
id="fnanc545">545</a></p>

<p>This justice must be rendered him that, while his
book is full of “straunge thingis,” he never adds any
of his own invention; when he says, this I have seen, it
can, if not afterwards destroyed, still be seen to-day;
when he copies an inscription, his copy, as can be easily
verified, is accurate. But, fond of books, he believed
in them; who ever failed to believe in what he loved?
The “Mirabilia Romæ” are the guide of this guide-book
maker;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn546" id="fnanc546">546</a>
so that to the enumeration of the holy places
with their relics and indulgences, and his description of
the ancient, now vanished, church of St. Peter, and all
the famous sanctuaries of the papal city, he adds the
wonders of fabulous Rome, with the temple on Capitol
hill, and in it, “a mervelous craft, that of every region
of the world stood an ymage made all of tre and in his
hand a lytil belle; as often as ony of these regiones was
in purpos to rebelle a geyn the grete mageste of Rome,
a non this ymage that was assigned to that regioun schulde
knylle his bell.” This device, so celebrated in the middle
ages, was due to that great enchanter “Virgil,” the magic
of whose lines had been appreciated for different motives
in Roman days. <span class="xxpn" id="p389">{389}</span></p>

<p>The attractions of Rome were, for the pilgrim, without
peer in Italy, but other cities could almost rival it; Venice
especially was full of wonders, and was admired and
visited accordingly, witness, for example, the travelling
notes of a troop of French pilgrims in the year 1395.
In this “most excellent, noble, great and fine town all
seated in the sea,” may be seen, they aver, the arm of
“our Lord St. George,” the burdon (staff) of St. Nicholas,
one of the water-pots of Cana, one ear of St. Paul, some
of the “roasted flesh of St. Lawrence turned to powder,”
three of the stones thrown at St. Stephen, the body of
St. Mark, “which is a very fine and noble thing.” There
is, besides, “in the Maison-Dieu of Venice one of
the molar teeth of a giant that was called Goliath,
which giant David killed, and know you that this tooth
is more than half a foot long and weighs twelve
pounds.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn547" id="fnanc547">547</a></p>

<p>Thus did returning travellers relate their recollections,
to the delighted wonderment of their countrymen. The
wish to set out in their turn was awakened in them, and
those who remained in their village associated themselves
to the pious journey by their prayers and some small
gift of money. All along his road the pilgrim found
similar dispositions; to receive and help him was to
share in his merits, and thus it was that people in the
humblest ranks, assisted from place to place,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn548" id="fnanc548">548</a>
could
accomplish distant pilgrimages. The rules of several gilds
provided for the case of a member setting out to fulfil
a vow. In order to participate in his good work, all the
“bretheren and sisteren” accompanied him out of the
town, and on bidding him farewell offered
him their gift. <span class="xxpn" id="p390">{390}</span>
They watched their friend go off with his deliberate step,
beginning a journey across many countries, to last many
months, sometimes several years. They returned to the
town, and the elders, who knew the world, no doubt
told what strange things their friend was like to see in
those distant lands, and what subjects for edification he
would meet with on his way.</p>

<p>The gild of the Resurrection at Lincoln, founded in
1374, had among its rules, “If any brother or sister
wishes to make pilgrimage to Rome, St. James of Galicia,
or the Holy Land, he shall forewarn the gild; and all
the bretheren and sisteren shall go with him to the city
gate, and each shall give him a half-penny at least.” The
same rule was observed by the Fullers’ gild of Lincoln,
founded in 1297; the pilgrim going to Rome was accompanied
as far as Queen’s Cross, outside the town, if he
left on a Sunday or a feast-day; and if he could let them
know of his return, and it were not a working day, all
went to meet him at the same place and accompanied
him to the monastery. The tailors of the same city also
gave a half-penny to him among them who was going to
Rome or St. James, and a penny to him who went to the
Holy Land. The ordinances of the Gild of the Virgin,
founded at Hull in 1357, had: “If any brother or sister
of the gild wishes, at any time, to make a pilgrimage to
the Holy Land, then, in order that all the gild may share
in his pilgrimage, he shall be fully released from his
yearly payment until his return.”</p>

<p>Some gilds kept open house for pilgrims, always
with the same object of having a part thereby in the
merits of the traveller. Thus the gild-merchant of
Coventry, founded in 1340, maintained “a common
lodging-house of thirteen beds,” to receive poor travellers
who cross the country going on pilgrimage or from any
other pious motive. This hostelry was managed by a
governor, aided by a woman who washed the
feet of the <span class="xxpn" id="p391">{391}</span>
guests and took care of them. The annual expenditure
on this foundation was ten pounds sterling.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn549" id="fnanc549">549</a></p>

<p>When one of the king’s servants had a pilgrimage to
make, the prince, in consideration of his motive, willingly
authorized him to depart, and even helped him with
money. Edward III gave to William Clerk, one of his
messengers, one pound six shillings and eightpence, to
help him in his expenses during the pilgrimage undertaken
by him to Jerusalem and Mount Sinai.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn550" id="fnanc550">550</a>
If the
man were of great importance, and especially if he intended
to fight the unbelievers, public prayers were offered for
his journey, his “triumphal fighting,” and his safe
return, as was done when Henry of Lancaster, cousin
to Edward III, went “to the parts beyond sea with
certain great and noble men of this realm” to attack
the enemies of the cross, in this case, the pagans of
Prussia. The prayers were prescribed for Sundays and
fête days, when there would be “the greatest multitude
of people in the churches.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn551" id="fnanc551">551</a></p>

<p>All this in spite of the fourteenth century’s not being,
as we have seen, an age of deep and true devotion. The
Popes lived at Avignon, their prestige was declining,
particularly in England; even bishops showed at
times scant respect for the Roman Court. Nowhere can
be found, not even in Wyclif, more daring accusations
and more scandalous anecdotes concerning the Pope
than in the chronicle written by Thomas of Burton, Abbot
of Meaux, near Beverley. He even speaks with a tinge
of irony of indulgences. As a special favour to the faithful
who died during a pilgrimage to Rome, Clement VI
“ordered the angels of Paradise,” writes the abbot, “to
lead their souls straight to the gates
of heaven without <span class="xxpn" id="p392">{392}</span>
making them pass through purgatory.” The same Pope
granted what the pilgrim of the “Stacions” seems to
have ignored, that those who looked upon the holy sudary
should return to the state they were in before baptism.
Lastly, “he confirmed all the indulgences granted by
two hundred sovereign pontiffs his predecessors, which
are innumerable.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn552" id="fnanc552">552</a>
Clement was, indeed, the two
hundredth.</p>

<p>At the period when monastic chroniclers did not
scruple to record anecdotes on the Roman Court like
those in Thomas of Burton’s, general devotion was not
merely lessened, it was disorganized, unbalanced. The
chroniclers show, indeed, that excesses of impiety coexisted
with excesses of fervour; the false pardoner,
retailer of the merits of the saints, fell in upon the highway
with the bleeding flagellant.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn553" id="fnanc553">553</a>
The papacy might show
commendable good sense by its condemnations of both;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn554" id="fnanc554">554</a>
its decrees did not suffice to restore
the equilibrium of <span class="xxpn" id="p393">{393}</span>
men’s minds, and the bounds of reason were continually
being passed; in ardent piety as in impious revolt men
went to the verge of madness. The account of the repulsive
sacrileges committed in York Cathedral by the
partisans of the Bishop of Durham seems unbelievable,
yet the facts cannot be doubted, being reported by the
archbishop himself.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn555" id="fnanc555">555</a>
Faith weakened or went astray;
men became at once sceptical and intolerant. It was
not in them the modern, serenely cold and imperturbable
scepticism, but a violent movement of the entire being,
impelled to burn what it adores. The man acts by fits;
he doubts his doubt, his burst of laughter dazes him;
he has had his revel and his orgy, and when the white
light of morning comes he will be the prey of despair,
shed tears, be racked with anguish, proclaim his conversion
and vow maybe to go on a pilgrimage. Walsingham
sees one of the causes of the peasants’ revolt in the incredulity
of the barons: “Some among them believe, it is
said, that there is no God, they deny the sacrament of
the altar and resurrection after death, and consider that
as is the end of the beast of burden, so is the end of man
himself.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn556" id="fnanc556">556</a></p>

<p>Such incredulity did not exclude superstitious
practices. To go straight forward was the privilege of
the happy few; the many, instead of opening the gates of
heaven with their own hands, imagined they could have it
done by that of others; they had Paradise gained for them
by the neighbouring monastery, as they had their <span
class="xxpn" id="p394">{394}</span> lands tilled for them
by their tenants; eternal welfare had become a matter of
commerce and could be bought with the letters of fraternity
of the mendicant friars and the lying indulgences of
false pardoners. Men lived at their ease, and when the
sad hour came, made pious donations in their wills, as if
they could, according to the strong words of the French
historian, Claude de Seyssel, “corrupt and win over by
gifts God and the saints, whom we ought to appease by good
works and by penitence for our sins.”<a class="afnanc"
href="#fn557" id="fnanc557">557</a> Very instructive
reading is that of the last wills and testaments of the
rich lords of the fourteenth century. Pages are filled with
devotional bequests; gifts are left to shrines, convents,
chapels, and hermits; testators who had abstained from
going in their lifetime, made pilgrimages by proxy after
their death, paying the proxy. The same Humphrey Bohun
who sent “a good man and true” to the tomb of Thomas of
Lancaster, also ordered that after his demise a priest
should be sent to Jerusalem, “chiefly,” said he, “for my
lady mother, and for my lord father, and for ourselves,”
with the obligation to say masses at all the chapels which
he might meet on his way.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn558"
id="fnanc558">558</a> Elizabeth de Burgh, Lady Clare,
ordered by her will, that five men-at-arms should fight
in her name in case there should be a “comune vyage,”
otherwise a crusade, within seven years following her
death. They would receive one hundred marks each, and the
merit of their fights would accrue to their employer,
and not to themselves, their own recompense being of
this world, and consisting in the hundred marks.<a

<div class="section">
<h4>V</h4>

<p>Most difficult and holiest of all, the pilgrimage to
Jerusalem remained, in spite of so many indulgences
attached by the Popes to the churches in Rome, the one
without peer, as well as it was the oldest established;
it dated back, indeed, from, at least, the days of Constantine.
Settled in Palestine during the fourth century, St. Jerome
writes to Paulinus: “From all the world people are
flocking here. The whole of mankind fills the city.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn560" id="fnanc560">560</a></p>

<p>This is confirmed by his friend the enthusiastic
Paula, in whose veins flowed the ardent blood of the
Scipios and the Gracchi, and who trying to persuade
her beloved Marcella, a rich and pious Roman matron,
to join them there, tells her that all the greatest and best,
those from Gaul, those from Britain, “divisus ab orbe
nostro Britannus” (for she, too, knows those classics
whom Jerome constantly quotes), without speaking of
the Persians, the Armenians, and all the East, are to be
met in the Holy Land: “A variety of languages, but
one only religion.” There are “so many places of prayer
that one cannot visit them all in one day.” And such
places! “What sentences, what words would be appropriate
to tell you of the cave of our Saviour? and of that
stable where, as a babe, He cried: a spot to be honoured
rather by silence than by inadequate words. Where are
the vast porticoes, the gilt canopies? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. In this poor
earthly place the Maker of heaven was born; here He
was wrapped in swadling clothes, here seen by the shepherds,
here revealed by a star, here adored by the Magi.”
Come, Oh come! “Will not the moment arrive when
a breathless traveller shall announce to us that our
Marcella has reached Palestine .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Will not the day
come when we can visit together
the Saviour’s grotto, <span class="xxpn" id="p396">{396}</span>
weep at His tomb, kiss the wood of the cross, and be
raised in our minds with the rising Lord on the Mount
of Olives?”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn561" id="fnanc561">561</a></p>

<p>But even then, thoughtful, level-headed St. Jerome
feared that enthusiasm might be carried too far, and
everyday duties neglected for the excitement of the
Palestine journey. It was, of course, in itself a pious
and laudable thing, if one could properly do so, to come
and venerate “the places where the feet of our Lord
had stood, and the almost recent traces left of His
nativity and His passion.” But this should not be
considered a Christian’s chief duty: “Do not think
that something is lacking in your faith because you
have not seen Jerusalem. I do not consider myself any
better because I live here.” To lead a good life is
the chief thing: “What is praiseworthy is not to have
been at Jerusalem, but to have lived righteously there. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
The places where the cross was and the Resurrection
occurred, benefit those who bear their cross and
who, with Christ, rise again every day. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The palace
of heaven is just as accessible from Britain as from
Jerusalem.” To thousands who have never seen the
holy city “the gate of paradise is wide open. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A
grand thing it is to be a Christian, not to seem one.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn562" id="fnanc562">562</a></p>

<p>The movement, however, once started never stopped.
On the contrary, it gathered strength; hospices for pilgrims
going to Jerusalem dotted the roads leading to
their usual places of embarkation (chiefly Marseilles and
Venice), several being built at the principal crossings of
the Alps, the Great and the Little Saint Bernard, the St.
Gothard, Mount Cenis, etc. A
“Confrérie des Pélerins <span class="xxpn" id="p397">{397}</span>
de la Terre Sainte” had been founded in Paris for them
by Louis, first Duke of Bourbon, who, greatly interested,
like his grand father Saint Louis, in the freeing of the
Holy Sepulchre, and bearing for a time the empty title of
King of Thessalonica, had been chosen as leader of one
of those numerous crusades that never took place.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn563" id="fnanc563">563</a></p>

<p>During a period of two hundred years pilgrimages
to Jerusalem had had, indeed, for their object a conquest
and not simply an inspection of the holy places. All
nations had taken part, from the first of those prodigious
attempts, the crusades, in 1096, to the last one in 1270,
in which St. Louis died before the walls of Tunis, while
his companion, young Edward of England, loth to give
up, had sworn not to go home without having struck
a blow at the Saracens in Holy Land, and returned as
King Edward I, wounded, but having occupied Acre
and kept his word.</p>

<p>The crusade, after those great expeditions, eight in
number, continued to be talked about as much as ever;
mere talk, it is true, in most cases. In the midst of their
wars the kings of France and of England berated each
other for being the only hindrance to the departure of
the Christians, for neither would go, leaving his rival
behind, free to act in his absence. Philip VI of Valois
and Edward III both protest that, but for the other, they
would go and fight the Saracen. “It is the fault of the
English,” writes Philip, “that the holy journey beyond
sea has been hindered.” It is the doing of
the King of <span class="xxpn" id="p398">{398}</span>
France, solemnly proclaims Edward III to the world,
which has turned him from the “sancto passagio transmarino.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn564" id="fnanc564">564</a></p>

<p>The utmost that was usually attempted,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn565" id="fnanc565">565</a>
now consisted
in small, ineffectual expeditions, so ill-conceived at times
as to cause the wonderment and even the merriment of
the infidel: such as the Franco-Anglo-Genoese crusade
of 1390, with Louis, third Duke of Bourbon, as
commander-in-chief, and which, on the recommendation
of the Genoese, who suffered more than any from the
inroads of the Barbaresques, went to lay siege, of all places,
to the city of Mahdia, the “Aufrike” of Froissart,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn566" id="fnanc566">566</a>
on
the east coast of Tunisia. The French were apparently
the most numerous, but, says Froissart, “Also the Duke
of Lancastre had a bastarde sonne called Henry of Lancastre:
he had devocion to go in the same voyage, and
he provided him of good knightes and squiers of
Englande that accompanyed him in that voyage.” The
comte de Foix had also, ready at hand, a “bastarde sonne”
of his own, whom he sent with a large retinue. The
English prince was not, however, the future Henry IV,
who was no bastard, but his half-brother, John Beaufort,
who being an adulterine son well answered to the description.
Henry had intended to go, hence Froissart’s mistake,
but he went instead to fight the pagans in Prussia
and Lithuania, and, being fond of pilgrimages and
shrines, performed, as a pilgrim, the journeys to Rome
and Jerusalem, before he assumed the crown and had,
in spite of his religious dispositions, his cousin Richard
assassinated. <span class="xxpn" id="p399">{399}</span></p>

<p>The start from Genoa for the new Tunisian expedition
was splendid to see; so the starts usually were:
“Great pleasure it was,” says Froissart, “to beholde
their departynge, and to se their standardes, getornes
(banners) and penons, wavynge in the wynde, shynynge
against the sonne, and to here the trompettes and claryons
sowning in the ayre with other mynstrelsy,” so that the
whole sea rang with the music.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn567" id="fnanc567">567</a></p>

<p>The Saracens were dumbfounded at this visit: what
had they done, and what could be the object? That the
Genoese had grudges against them was natural enough;
but what ailed the others? Ready for the stoutest defence
of their walled Mahdia, they were, however, curious to
ascertain the reason, and they sent one of their number,
who spoke Italian, to explain “howe we have in nothynge
trespassed them; of a trouthe, afore this tyme, there
hath been warre bytwene us and the Genovoys,” but that
does not concern Christians from “farre countreys.”
The Genoese “are our neighbours, they take of us and
we of them; we have been auncyente enemyes and shall
be, excepte whan treuce is betwene us.” But why are
the others interfering?</p>

<p>The leaders of the army agreed that a reply should
be sent; they held council, twelve of them, “in the
duke of Burbons tent,” and gave an answer to the effect
that the reason why they made this war “was bycause
the Sonne of God, called Jesu Chryst .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. by their
lyne and generacyon, was put to deth and crucyfyed,”
and also because the Saracens did not believe in baptism,
nor “in the Virgyn Mary, Mother to Jhesu Cryst. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>“At this aunswere the Sarazyns dyd nothinge but
laugh and sayd howe that aunswere
was nothynge <span class="xxpn" id="p400">{400}</span>
reasonable, for it was the Jewes that put Chryst to dethe and
not they. Thus the siege still endured.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn568" id="fnanc568">568</a></p>

<p>The usual ally of the infidel did not fail him: sickness,
fevers, and epidemics worked havoc among the besiegers,
who had, of all months, selected July for their attempt.
They tried to storm the city, but were repulsed with great
loss, and after some eight weeks of fruitless labour, brilliant
combats, and many deaths, accepted a patched-up treaty
granting the Genoese some slight advantage; raised the
siege, and returned home, with probably less “trompettes
and claryons sowning in the ayre” than when they had
started.</p>

<p>The acceptance of a discussion with the infidel during
this abortive crusade was characteristic of the time.
More prone than before to examine inherited beliefs, a
good many men were found in the fourteenth century to
question the very principle of the crusade. We crush
the infidel, why not convert him? Is it not wiser, more
reasonable, and even more conformable to the religion of
Christ? Were the apostles whom He sent to us Gentiles
covered with armour and provided with swords? Reflections
like these occur in the works, not only of reforming
minds like Wyclif or Langland,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn569" id="fnanc569">569</a>
but of pious well-meaning
conservative thinkers like Gower, who says in his
“Confessio Amantis”:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>To
 sleen and fighten they us bidde</div>
<div class="dpp00">Hem whom they shuld, as the boke saith,</div>
<div class="dpp00" id="p401">Converten unto Cristes feith.</div>
<div class="dpp00">But herof have I great merveile</div>
<div class="dpp00">How they wol bidde me traveile;</div>
<div class="dpp00">A Saracen if I slee shall,</div>
<div class="dpp00">I slee the soule forth withall,</div>
<div class="dpp00">And that was never Cristes lore.”</div>
</div></div>

<p>Failing crusades, then, just as before those great
mil­i­tary under­tak­ings had be­gun, small troops of pilgrims,
privately formed, started on the road to Jerusalem, still
in their eyes, in spite of all St. Jerome might have said,
the best road to heaven. They were, however, many of
them, inspired by mixed motives, for this was also the
road to adventure, and there, again, were very apparent
the chivalric and restless instincts of the period.</p>

<p>A good number of such caravans came from England;
the English were already, and had been even before, and
continue to this day, great travellers. They were to be met
everywhere, and their knowledge of French stood them in
good stead in most of the countries they went through.
This was, as “Mandeville” states, the common language
of the upper classes everywhere;<a class="afnanc" href="#fn570" id="fnanc570">570</a>
it was also that spoken
in the East by the European, the “Frank.” Trevisa,
finding that the English were forgetting that language,
deplores it; how will they do if they go abroad? “That
is harme for hem and they schulle passe the see and
travaille in straunge landes and in many other places.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn571" id="fnanc571">571</a>
They tried to acquire notions of it before setting out on
their travels, and employed competent persons to compose
manuals of conversation for them to learn,
in the words <span class="xxpn" id="p402">{402}</span>
of the author of one such work, an Englishman of the
fourteenth century, “how to speak and pronounce well,
and to write correctly sweet French, which is the finest
and most graceful language, the noblest to speak of any
in the world after Latin of the schools, and is better prized
and loved than any other by all men; for God made it
so sweet and lovable chiefly to His own praise and honour.
And therefore it may well compare with the language of
the angels in heaven, on account of its great sweetness
and beauty.” So spoke this teacher of what he had to
teach.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn572" id="fnanc572">572</a></p>

<p>The English went much abroad; every author who
draws their portrait lays stress on their taste for moving
about, and their love of distant travel; the moon is
considered, in consequence, as their planet. According
to Gower, the moon’s influence is the cause why they
visit so many far-off countries:</p>

<div class="dpoemlft"><div class="dstanzalft">
<div class="dquoteverse"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Bot
 what man under his [<i>i.e.</i>, the moon’s] pouer</div>
<div class="dpp00">Is bore, he schall his place change</div>
<div class="dpp00">And seche manye londes strange;</div>
<div class="dpp00">And as of this condicion</div>
<div class="dpp00">The Mones disposicion</div>
<div class="dpp00">Upon the lond of Alemaigne</div>
<div class="dpp00">Is set, and ek upon Bretaigne,</div>
<div class="dpp00">Which nou is cleped Engelond,</div>
<div class="dpp00">For thei travaile in every lond.”<a
class="afnanc" href="#fn573" id="fnanc573">573</a></div>
</div></div>

<p>Wyclif places them under the patronage of the same
planet, but draws different conclusions therefrom;<a
class="afnanc" href="#fn574" id="fnanc574">574</a> <span
class="xxpn" id="p403">{403}</span> Ralph Higden the
chronicler expresses himself in these terms, most of which
seem prophetic, they have proved so exact: “That people
are curious enough that they may know and tell the wonders
that they have seen; they cultivate other regions, and
succeed still better in distant countries than in their
own, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. wherefore it is that they are spread
so wide through the earth, considering every other land
that they inhabit as their own country. They are a race
able for every industry.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn575"
id="fnanc575">575</a></p>

<p>A number of those adventure seekers were established
in Italy, where they had become <i>condottieri</i>, and went
fighting up and down the peninsula according to the will
of whomsoever paid them. Such were John Hawkwood,
whose tomb still adorns the cathedral at Florence,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn576" id="fnanc576">576</a>
William
Gold, and several others. Fierce folk they were, with
ardent passions, ready sometimes, as in Homeric days,
to do and sacrifice as much to recover a fugitive girl as
to take a town. One letter of William Gold may give
an idea of the temper of these bellicose wanderers. On
August 9, 1378, he wrote to Louis Gonzaga, lord of
Mantua, concerning the girl Jeannette, of France:</p>

<div class="dblockquote">
<p>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Let her be detained at my suit, for if you should
have a thousand golden florins spent for her, I will pay
them without delay; for if I should have to follow her
to Avignon I will obtain this woman. Now, my lord,
should I be asking a trifle contrary to law, yet ought you
not to cross me in this, for some day I shall do more for
you than a thousand united French
women could effect; <span class="xxpn" id="p404">{404}</span>
and if there be need of me in a matter of greater import,
you shall have for the asking a thousand spears at my
back. Therefore, in conclusion, again and again, I
entreat that this Janet may be put in a safe place unknown
to anybody, and there kept until I send some servant of
mine for her with a letter from myself, for I would do
more for you in greater matters. And I pray you, thwart
me not about putting her in a safe place, for you alone,
and no one else are lord in Mantua.</p>

<div class="spitalic">“The Camp under Verona, August 9, 1378.</div>

<p>“P.S.—I beseech by all means that [the] said Janet
may not quit Mantua, but be in safe custody, and so you
will have obliged me for ever.”</p></div>

<p>No less determined as a warrior than as a lover, and
accustomed, as it seems, in both cases, to put people
to flight, William Gold was made a citizen of Venice in
recognition of his services on April 27, 1380, and in July
of the same year received from the Doge Andrea Contarini
a pension of 500 gold ducats for life.<a class="afnanc"
href="#fn577" id="fnanc577">577</a></p>

<p>Thinking less of the Jeannettes to be met on the way,
troops of pilgrims sailed from England, beginning their
long journey towards the Holy Land, usually provided
with letters from their sovereign, to serve both as passports
and as recommendations in case of need. The
tenor of these documents, written in French or in Latin,
was usually similar to that of the following letter granted
by Edward III in 1354 to one who, it is true, was more
of a fighter than a pilgrim: “Know all men that the
noble Jean le Meingre, knight, otherwise Bussigand
[Boucicaut], our prisoner, is about to set forth, duly
licensed by us, with twelve knights to St. James, and thence
to march against the enemies of Christ in the Holy Land;
and that we have taken him and
his twelve companions, <span class="xxpn" id="p405">{405}</span>
their servants, horses, and harnesses under our protection
and safe conduct.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn578" id="fnanc578">578</a></p>

<p>Such travellers were well received by the French
King of Cyprus, of the famous Lusignan family; they
brought him news of the outer world, with them came
variety and hope; they also were sometimes able to
actually assist him in his difficulties, which were ceaseless,
and the king showed his pleasure in his letters. Thus
James I of Lusignan, “King of Jerusalem and Cyprus,”
writes from Nicosia, in 1393, to Richard II, that a knight
has no need of a personal recommendation to be welcome
in the island; his subjects always are. It was for him
an honour and delight to be visited by “your noble relative
the lord Henry Percy.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn579" id="fnanc579">579</a>
In the same manner the troop
of French pilgrims, to which belonged the lord of Anglure,
was welcomed in Cyprus, by the same king, in 1396.
They reached the island on their way home, after a fearful
storm, in which they nearly lost their lives.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn580" id="fnanc580">580</a>
As soon
as James heard of their having landed he
sent to them <span class="xxpn" id="p406">{406}</span>
provisions in plenty: a hundred chickens, twenty sheep,
two oxen, much good red wine and good white bread.
Then he asked them to his Court, where they were delightfully
entertained by him, by the queen, and their four
sons and five daughters. Being himself a great huntsman,
James asked them to go hunting with him, a pleasant
offer after so many trials, and one not to be refused.</p>

<p>Combats, hunts, storms, encounters of all sorts, in
a word, adventure, were thus associated with the idea of
the voyage, the holiness of which sometimes disappeared
in the midst of so many profane incidents. Well may
one wonder whether Saint James was the real attraction,
for a De Werchin, Seneschal de Hainaut, who, about to
start on a pilgrimage to the shrine of this saint, in 1402,
would make it publicly known that, “in the name of God,
of our Lord St. George, and of his own lady,” he would
accept during his whole journey the friendly combat of
arms with any knight for whom he should not have to
turn from his road more than 20 leagues. He announced
his itinerary beforehand, so that any one might make
ready.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn581" id="fnanc581">581</a></p>

<p>The strange man, Jean de Bourgogne by name, who
chose to sign his book of travels “Jean
de Mandeville,”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn582" id="fnanc582">582</a>
<span class="xxpn" id="p407">{407}</span>
gives somewhat similar reasons to explain why he undertook
his journey to the East in 1322 through perilous
seas and countries—or rather, according to modern discoveries—through
the books of his library. He started,
or, anyhow, he studied and wrote, partly, says he, to
sanctify himself, partly to know the world and its wonders,
and to be able to speak of them; for many persons, he
observes, are much pleased with hearing the marvels of
distant regions described. The reason he publishes
his impressions is, first, because numbers of people like
stories of the Holy Land, and find great consolation and
comfort in them; and, secondly, to make a guide, in
order that small companies or caravans, like that of
Boucicaut and others, may profit by his knowledge.</p>

<p>His ideas as to the road to be followed are not unreasonable.
Thus, “to go the direct way” from England to
Palestine, he advises the following itinerary: France,
Burgundy, Lombardy, Venice, Famagusta in Cyprus,
Jaffa, Jerusalem. Very often people went to Jerusalem
by way of Egypt. It was a tradition of long standing
that the greater part of the difficulties concerning the
Holy Land had their root in Egypt; many tombs of
saints also attracted the pilgrims there, so that crusaders,
or mere pilgrims, often took that road to Jerusalem.
“Mandeville” says he himself followed this itinerary.
In 1422 Gilbert de Lannoy wrote, “at the behest of
King Henry of England, heir and Regent of France,”
that is, Henry V, a description in French of the places
through which a crusade might be led against the infidels,
for this prince, like his predecessors, continued dreaming
of a crusade. Lannoy, a practical soldier and diplomat,
who speaks only of what he has seen, gives a detailed
account of all towns, stating which are
protected by walls, <span class="xxpn" id="p408">{408}</span>
towers and ditches; he notices the Venetians’ warehouses
for cotton at Acre, and the presence at Beirut of a great
number of Christian merchants, Venetians, Genoese,
Greeks, and others. He carefully mentions what sorts
of provisions in wood, water, etc., may be found in each
part of the country, in what plains an army can be easily
arrayed, in what ports a fleet shall be safe. He pays the
greatest attention to Egypt, and describes its several
cities: “Item. There is Cairo, the chief town of Egypt,
on the river Nile which comes from Paradise.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn583" id="fnanc583">583</a>
But the
crusade, in anticipation of which he wrote, never took
place, and the next military expedition to reach Syria
through Egypt was destined to be a French one, headed
by that extraordinary pilgrim, Bonaparte.</p>

<p>Besides his account of a journey to Egypt, Palestine,
Syria, Central Asia, and China, “Mandeville” gives a
description of a number of countries peopled by imaginary
monsters. This fantastic part of his work, where he
anticipated no less famous a traveller than Gulliver
himself, did not diminish its success, quite the contrary;
it was translated into several languages, and above
three hundred MSS. of it now remain. But we, less
confiding than our fathers, are loth to accept the excuse
he gives as a guarantee of, at least, his good faith:
“Things that are long past away from sight fall into
oblivion, and the memory of man cannot all retain and
comprehend.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn584" id="fnanc584">584</a></p>

<p>Many books, beginning with that of Lannoy, came
after his, more practical, less fantastic, and, of course,
less famous.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn585" id="fnanc585">585</a>
While the renewal of
the crusades became <span class="xxpn" id="p409">{409}</span>
less and less probable, the number of individual pilgrimages
was on the increase. The word of the priest which could
no longer uproot and set on the move entire nations,
still detached here and there little groups of pious men
or adventure seekers, who went to visit the holy places
under favour of the Saracen’s tolerant and practical spirit.
For the mass of them no longer set out to fight the
infidel, but to ask his permission to see Jerusalem, which
was the more readily granted that it had to be paid for.</p>

<p>From the fourteenth century onwards, a regular
service of transports existed at Venice for the use of pilgrims:
“It is the rule,” says a traveller of the fourteenth
century, “that the Venetians send every year five galleys
to the Holy Land. They all reach Beirut, which is the
port for Damascus in Syria; thence two of them bring
the pilgrims to Jaffa, which is the port for Jerusalem.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn586" id="fnanc586">586</a></p>

<p>Many particulars about this service of transports,
the purchases to make before starting, and the provisions
to take, are found in a book written in the following
century by William Wey, Fellow of Eton College, an
experienced pilgrim with a passion for such journeys.
He recommended that the price of the passage be carefully
settled before starting, and that a bed with its pillows,
sheets, etc., be procured. This was bought at Venice,
near St. Mark’s, and cost three ducats; after the journey
the whole could be sold back to the
vendor for a ducat <span class="xxpn" id="p410">{410}</span>
and a half: “Also when ye com to Venyse ye schal
by a bedde by seynt Markys cherche; ye schal have a
fedyr bedde, a matres, too pylwys, too peyre schetis and
a qwylt, and ye schal pay iij dokettis; and when ye com
ayen, bryng the same bedde to the man that ye bowt hit
of and ye schal have a doket and halfe ayen, thow hyt be
broke and worne.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn587" id="fnanc587">587</a>
Such settled customs and fixed
prices show better than anything else the frequency of
the intercourse.</p>

<p>William Wey is as obliging for his traveller as are
modern guide-book makers; he devises mnemonics of
names to remember, a vocabulary of the Greek words
most important to know, and ready-made questions which
our manuals still repeat in more correct language:</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth"><div class="nowrap">
<table summary="">
<tr>
 <td class="tdleft"><span class="spquotebox">“</span>Good morrow.</td>
 <td class="tdleft spitalic">Calomare.</td></tr>

</table></div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">He does not omit a sentence which must have been, and
still is, of especially frequent use: “I understond the
not—<i>Apopon kystys</i>.” Wey also gives a table of the rate
of exchange for moneys from England to Venice, Crete,
Rhodes, Cyprus, and Syria; and a programme for the
employment of time, as now very parsimoniously distributed;
he only allows “thirteen or fourteen
days” to see <span class="xxpn" id="p411">{411}</span>
everything and start back again, specifying what should
be seen each day. Lastly, he gives a complete list of the
towns to be traversed, with the distance from one to the
other, a map of the Holy Land with all the remarkable
places duly inscribed thereon,<a class="afnanc" href="#fn588" id="fnanc588">588</a>
a considerable catalogue
of the indulgences to be gained, and full details as to what
is sacred or curious in Palestine, or on the way thither,
not forgetting the dogs at Rhodes, who keep watch at
night outside the castle, know perfectly how to distinguish
a Turk from a Christian, and who, if one of their number
“sleeps instead of taking his watch at night outside the
castle, kill him themselves,”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn589" id="fnanc589">589</a>
so great is their detestation
of a <i>slacker</i>.</p>

<p>Wey foresaw all the disagreeables to which the boorishness
of the captain of the galley might subject you; he
recommends engaging a berth in the highest part of
the boat, “for in the lawyst [stage] under hyt is ryght
smolderyng hote and stynkynge.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn590" id="fnanc590">590</a>
You must not pay
more than forty ducats from Venice to Jaffa, food included,
and should stipulate that the captain stop at certain ports
to take in fresh provisions. He is bound to give you
hot meat at dinner and supper, good wine, pure water,
and biscuit; but it is well besides to take provisions for
private use, for even at the captain’s table there is great
risk of having bad bread and wine. “For
thow ye schal <span class="xxpn" id="p412">{412}</span>
be at the tabyl wyth yowre patrone, notwythstondynge,
ye schal oft tyme have nede to yowre vytelys, bred, chese,
eggys, frute, and bakyn, wyne, and other, to make yowre
collasyun; for sum tyme ye schal have febyl bred, wyne
and stynkyng water, meny tymes ye schal be ful fayne
to ete of yowre owne.” It would even be prudent to
take some poultry: “Also by yow a cage for half a dozen
of hennys or chekyn to have with yow in the galey;”
half a bushel of seed to feed them must not be forgotten,
nor what you will want to fry your own bacon and drink
your wine: “Also take with you a lytyl cawdren and
fryyng pan, dysches, platerrys, sawserys of tre (wood),
cuppys of glas, a grater for brede and such nessaryes.”
You must also have remedies, “confortatyvys, laxatyvys,
restoratyvys,” saffron, pepper, spices.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn591" id="fnanc591">591</a></p>

<p>On arrival at a port it is well to leap ashore one of
the first, in order to get served before others, and not to
have the leavings; this counsel of practical selfishness
often recurs. On land heed must be taken as to the
fruits: “beware of dyverse frutys, for they be not acordyng
to youre complexioun, and they gender a blody fluxe
(dysentery), and yf an Englyschman have that sykenes
hyt ys a marvel and scape hyt but he dye thereof.”</p>

<p>Once in Palestine, one must be careful about robbers;
beware of Saracens coming to talk familiarly with you:
“Also take goyd hede of yowre knyves and other smal
thynges that ye ber apon yow, for the Sarsenes wyl go
talkyng wyth yow and make goyd chere, but they wyl
stele fro yow that ye have and they may.” At Jaffa
you must bestir yourself and be quick, in order to have
the best donkey, “Also when ye schal take yowre asse
at port Jaffe, be not to longe behynde yowre felowys;
for and ye com by tyme ye may chese the beste mule,
other asse, for ye schal pay no more fore the best then
for the worst. And ye must yeve
youre asman curtesy <span class="xxpn" id="p413">{413}</span>
a grot.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn592" id="fnanc592">592</a>
This last recommendation shows the high
antiquity of “pourboires,” one of the best preserved of
mediæval traditions. At last the caravan leaves the
seaside and proceeds towards the Holy City; and then
it is prudent not to straggle too far from your companions
for fear of evildoers.</p>

<p>Worthy of notice is the fact that these visits to the
Holy Land were in great part performed on donkeys;
knights themselves did not disdain mounting these modest
animals: “At this said inn did we dismount from our
asses,” says the narrator of the travels of the lord of
Anglure, who, as we have seen, visited Jerusalem at the
end of the fourteenth century; which tends to show that
if there was, as there still is, some danger of attacks by
robbers, it was not very serious. If there had been any
chance of real fight knights would hardly have ventured
getting into it on donkey-back. In fact, many of those
reports of travels in the Holy Land give the impression
of mere tourists’ excursions, and what comes out most
clearly from them is the before-mentioned spirit of tolerance,
coupled with the spirit of profit, displayed by the
Saracen. He did not forbid the entry into Palestine of
all these pilgrims, who often came as spies and enemies,
and he let their troops do very much as they liked, provided
they did not forget to pay.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn593" id="fnanc593">593</a>
The companions
of the lord <span class="xxpn" id="p414">{414}</span>
of Anglure, and half a century later of William Wey, go
where they will; returning when it is convenient, and
making plans of excursions beforehand as they would do
at present. They admire the beauty of the “muscas” or
mosques, the quaint appearance of the vaulted streets with
light coming from apertures at the top of the vault, and
with shops for Saracen merchants on both sides, in other
words, the bazaar; they are led by and receive explanations
from their “drugemens;” at certain places they
meet officers entrusted with the permit of the “Soudan,”
as to all affairs concerning foreigners: these officers are
called “consulles.” They find European merchants established
and doing much trade in the ports of the infidel;
they have, in fact, nothing to fear seriously but local
wars (about which they were pretty sure to get timely
information), or possibly calamitous encounters at sea.
William Wey and his companions learn with much uneasiness
on their return that a Turkish fleet with dubious
purpose is ready to quit Constantinople, but happily they
do not meet it.</p>

<p>A comparison between the experiences of both troops
of pilgrims, the French and the English, is instructive,
precisely because they are, in so many cases, similar.
The lord of Anglure<a class="afnanc" href="#fn594" id="fnanc594">594</a>
had no trouble in reaching Jerusalem,
being provided with the proper authorization: “Shortly
after, we started thence on foot, and with the license of
the lieutenant of the Sultan we entered the
holy city of <span class="xxpn" id="p415">{415}</span>
Jerusalem at the hour of vespers, and were all received
and lodged in the hospital where it is customary now for
pilgrims to stay.” Having bought tents, they travel by
land without difficulty from Palestine to Egypt, crossing
the desert, noticing the places where Moses performed
his miracles, visiting Cairo, which deeply impresses them
by its beauty, its greatness, its gardens and monuments,
and the immense number of Saracens living there. They
go partly by water, partly on camels, observing on their
way “two great black-feathered ostriches trotting along,”
to the places where St. Anthony had lived with his “porcellet,”
and where churches and abbeys prosper under the
rule of the unmeddling Saracen. They navigate the
Nile, a large river which “comes from Paradise,” and
where “live several serpents called cokatrices,” otherwise
crocodiles, of which they see one “very great and
hideous” that dived into the water when they came near.
There only they have a rather narrow escape, being
attacked in their boat by “Arab robbers,” and some of
their troop are wounded with arrows, but none is killed.</p>

<p>Needless to say that, if Rome was full of relics, there
was no want of them in Jerusalem. All the places named
in the Gospel, and some others, had been identified
with precision: “Item, continuing to go up towards
this mountain on the right hand side, there is a house
where the sweet Virgin Mary learnt at school.” Near
the church of the Holy Sepulchre is a large square “with
two big stones on the one of which our Lord used to sit
when He preached to His disciples, and our Lady sat
opposite on the other.” The place is shown “where
St. John the Evangelist sang mass every day in the
presence of our Lady after the Ascension of our Lord.”
You may see, too, the spot where was roasted the paschal
lamb; “even here was warmed the water with which
our Lord washed the feet of His apostles.” There is
also a cave or well “where King Herod
had the Innocents <span class="xxpn" id="p416">{416}</span>
thrown, out of spite.” At Bethlehem is a church of
St. Nicholas, “in which place the sweet Virgin Mary
hid herself to draw her milk from her worthy breasts
when she would fly to Egypt. In this same church is
a marble column against which she leaned when she drew
her worthy milk, and this pillar continues moist since
the time she leaned against it, and when it is wiped, at
once it sweats again; and in all places where her worthy
milk fell, the earth is still soft and white and has the
appearance of curded milk, and whoever likes takes of
it, out of devotion.”—Hence the milk at Walsingham?</p>

<p>In Egypt, too, the wonders are numerous, but many
are of a different order. Besides the churches and
hermitages there are the “granaries of Pharaoh,” namely
the pyramids, which seem to the lord of Anglure and
his companions “the most marvellous thing they had
yet seen in all their travels.” They are cut “in the shape
of a fine diamond,” but inside they are full of animals,
who stink horribly. Mandeville, who had seen them
some years before, gives them the same origin, and utterly
discards the belief that they might have been tombs of
high personages. He mentions the hieroglyphics, about
the only thing in all his book that he does not try to
explain; he also has a word for the grim inhabitants of
the pyramids: “Thei ben alle fulle of serpentes. And
aboven the gernerers with outen ben many scriptures
of dyverse languages. And sum men seyn that they
ben sepultures of grete Lordes, that weren somtyme;
but that is not trewe; for all the comoun rymour and
speche is of alle the peple there, bothe far and nere, that
thei ben the garneres of Joseph. And so fynden thei
in here scriptures and in here cronycles. On that other
partie, yif thei werein sepultures, thei scholden not ben
voyd with inne. For yee may well knowe that tombes
and sepultures ne ben not made of suche gretnesse ne of
suche highnesse. Wherfore it is not to
beleve that thei <span class="xxpn" id="p417">{417}</span>
ben tombes or sepultures.”<a class="afnanc" href="#fn595" id="fnanc595">595</a>
This powerful mode of
reasoning did not, however, convince such sceptics as
Mariette and Maspéro.</p>

<p>Besides the pyramids, the companions of the Lord of
Anglure notice and greatly praise the houses with their
terraces, the mosques and their “fine lamps,” these same
ornamented glass lamps which, after having been admired
by our pilgrims in 1395 when they were fresh and new,
can be seen now without going so far, in the Victoria and
Albert Museum. The Egyptian animals, too, are noted
by our travellers as being very striking; besides the
crocodiles there are the long-necked giraffes, so tall that
“they could well take their provender on the highest
lances that it is the custom now to use,” and then the
elephants. A very strange beast an elephant: “It
could never bend to the ground to get its food on account
of its great height, but it has in its snout something like
a bowel, put at the further end of its snout,” and this
bowel “hangs down almost to the ground,” and with it
the beast “takes its food and carries it to its mouth.”
He uses it also to drink, and “when he blows air through
it the noise is greater than that of any buccina,” and the
sound “is terrible to those unaccustomed.”</p>

<p>At last the time came when our pilgrims had seen
everything, and they had to wend their way homewards.
Twice did William Wey undertake the great journey,
happy to have seen, fain to see again. When he came
back to England for the last time he bequeathed to a
chapel, built on the model of the Holy Sepulchre, the
souvenirs which he had brought back, that is to say, a
stone from Calvary, another from the Sepulchre itself,
one from Mount Tabor, one from the place where the
cross stood, and other relics. As for the French troop
of pilgrims who had left Anglure-sur-Aube
on July 16, <span class="xxpn" id="p418">{418}</span>
1395, they came back in the following year, complete
in their numbers but for Simon de Sarrebruck, who had
died of fever in Cyprus during the journey home, and
lies interred in a church there. “And on Thursday,
the twenty-second day of June, and the day before the
eve of the feast of St. John the Baptist, in the year of
grace of our Lord, 1396, we found ourselves again dining
in Anglure.”</p>

<span class="hbig">CONCLUSION</span></h3>

<p class="pfirst">We have followed the race of roamers in many
places: on the road, at the hostelry, in woods,
in taverns, in churches; we have seen them
exercising a host of different trades, a motley crew, minstrels,
buffoons, quacks, messengers, pedlars, pilgrims,
wandering preachers, beggars, friars, vagabonds of all
sorts, labourers broken loose from the soil, pardoners,
knights in search of adventure. We have accompanied
them here and there over the highroads of England, and
followed them to Rome itself, and the Holy Land;
there we shall leave them. To the wandering class also
belong the representatives of many other professions,
such as scribes, tinkers, cobblers, masons, showers of
animals or bearwards, like those whom Villard de
Honnecourt visited one day in order to draw “al vif,”
a lion. But the more important members are those
above described.</p>

<p>The current of life represented by the multiplicity of
these wayfarers is powerful; notice has been taken of the
great though not very apparent part they played in the
State. The labourer breaks the bonds which for centuries
have attached him to the manor,
and henceforward means <span class="xxpn" id="p420">{420}</span>
to be the master of his own person and of his service, to
hire himself by the day if he chooses, and for a salary
corresponding to the rise in prices and to the demand
there may be for his work. The reform is an inevitable
one, which will be realized by degrees, in spite of the laws
and of the will of the authorities. There is none more
important, and its how and wherefore are to be studied
not only in the castle, but on the road and by-ways, in
the brushwood, where armed bands meet together during
church service, and on those unfrequented paths where
the false pilgrim throws down his staff to take up his tools
and look for work out of the reach of his hereditary master.
These people promote by their example and success the
emancipation which the wandering preachers justify in
their discourses, showing it to be not simply desirable,
but rightful.</p>

<p>The great questions of the age, social and religious,
move towards their solution, partly on the road, through
the influence of the wanderers, a direct influence from
the sincere ones, indirect from the others. Begging friars
go from door to door, pardoners grow rich, pilgrims live
by alms and by the recital of their adventures, always on
the way, always at work. What is this work? By constantly
addressing the crowd, they in the end make themselves
known for what they are, and cause their listeners
to pass sentence upon them; by disabusing them they
render reform inevitable. Thereby, too, will the rust and
superstition of the middle ages drop away, and another
step be made towards modern civilization.</p>

<p>Each of these strange types has, moreover, the advantage
of showing, very apparent in his own person, some characteristic
side of the tastes, the beliefs, and the aspirations
of his time. Each of those groups corresponds to a need,
an eccentricity, a vice, or a merit of the nation; through
them we may examine, as it were, and reconstitute piecemeal
the souls of the men of long ago,
and have those <span class="xxpn" id="p421">{421}</span>
men stand before us, mind and body, complete, just as the
nature of the soil may be guessed from the flora of a country.</p>

<p>The general impression is that the English people
then underwent one of those profound transformations
which present themselves to the historian’s view like the
turning of a highway. Coming out from gorges and
mountains the road suddenly leads to an opening, and the
rich, sunny, fertile plain is perceived in the distance. It
has not yet been reached, many hardships are still to be
endured; it will disappear again from sight at intervals,
but the traveller has seen it, and knows at least in what
direction to tread in order to attain it. During the age
which was then beginning the emancipated peasant was
to enrich himself in spite of fierce wars especially deadly
for the nobility, and the Commons were to be possessed
of an instrument of control over the royal power, which
would be used, according to the period, more or less well,
but which is the best one invented up to our day. The
Parliament sitting at Westminster now is in its essential
elements identical with the one that, under the Plantagenets,
drew up the statutes of the kingdom. In the fourteenth
century, despite ultra severe judgments from some thinkers
of fame (an age, says Stubbs, “of heartless selfishness
and moral degradation”), mankind did not recede,
witness the host of truly modern ideas which gained a
hold on the mass of the people; among the upper classes
under the influence of higher education and wider intercourse
with foreign countries, which weakened the notion
of the immutability of custom; among the lower classes
through the effects of abuses long experienced by men
who, though patient, were no weaklings; ideas made
popular and rendered practical by the wayfarers, illiterate
workmen, single-hearted preachers. All those mad freaks,
all the extravagance of the religious spirit, those incessant
revolts and follies which have been noticed, were sure to
cause a reaction, and a longing for
something nearer that <span class="xxpn" id="p422">{422}</span>
reign of reason which mankind, though less remote from
the goal, still continues to look for in the far distance.</p>

<p>On a number of questions, whether as the promoter
or the object of reform, as working man or as pardoner,
whether an unconscious instrument or not, wanderers will
always have much to teach whoever will question them.
For good or evil it may be said that they acted in mediæval
history as “microbes,” a numerous, scarcely visible, but
powerful host. They will perhaps reveal the secret of
almost incomprehensible transformations, which might have
seemed to necessitate a total overturn, like the one that
took place in France at the end of the eighteenth century,
a new or rather a first <i>contrat social</i>. England, for many
reasons, has not required this; one among those reasons
is the action of the roamers which, exerting itself on a
population temperamentally steadier than many others,
more persistently resolute, and less constantly troubled by
wars on its territory, united the people and, thanks to
that union which made it strong, allowed it to snatch
in time the necessary concessions. And as, however, the
calmest changes cannot take place without some disturbance,
as also among the English there have been, in
the course of centuries, more than one bloody fray, the
nomad may perhaps end by answering his interrogator
in the words of a common proverb of certain, yet unhackneyed
wisdom, which should prevent pessimism and
lack of hope: “Le bois tortu fait le feu droit”—Crooked
log maketh straight fire.</p>

<span class="hatitle">LONDON BRIDGE AND ITS MAINTENANCE</span></h3>

<p>At the end of his edition of the “Liber niger Scaccarii,” London,
1771, vol. i. pp. 470&#x2a;-478&#x2a;, Hearne printed a series of curious Letters
Patent relating to London Bridge. That of John, commending
Isembert to the city, is given above (Appendix I.). There follow,
an order of John applying the tax paid by foreign merchants established
in London to the support of the bridge (Close Roll, 15 John, m. 3);
a patent of Henry III addressed “to the brothers and chaplains
of the chapel of St. Thomas on London Bridge, and
to the other <span class="xxpn" id="p428">{428}</span>
persons living on the same bridge,” to inform them that the convent
of St. Catherine’s Hospital, near the Tower, would receive the
revenues and would take charge of the repairs of the bridge for
five years (Patent 50 Hen. III m. 43, No. 129); grant of the
same revenues and charge to the queen for six years (54 Hen. III
m. 4, No. 11); patent of Edward I (January, 1281), ordering
a general collection throughout the kingdom to ward off the danger
resulting from the bad condition of the edifice (9 Ed. I m. 27);
patent of the same king ordering the levy of an extraordinary tax
on account of the catastrophe which, after all, had happened.</p>

<p>“Rex majori suo London’ salutem. Propter subitam ruinam
pontis London’ vobis mandamus quod associatis vobis duobus vel
tribus de discretioribus et legalioribus civibus civitatis prædictæ,
capiatis usque ad parliamentum nostrum post Pasch’ prox’ futur’,
in subsidium reparationis pontis predicti, consuetudinem subscriptam,
videlicet, de quolibet homine transeunte aquam Thamisiæ ex transverso
ex utraque parte pontis London’ de London’ usque Suthwerk
et de Suthwerk usque London’, occasione defectus reparationis pontis
predicti, unum quadrantem, de quolibet equo sic transeunte ibidem
unum denarium, et de quolibet summagio sic ibidem transeunte
unum obolum. Set volumus quod aliquid ibidem hac occasione
interim capiatur nisi in subsidium reparationis pontis supra dicti.
In cujus, etc. Teste rege apud Cirencestr’, iiijº die Februarij”
(10 E. I m. 18).</p>

<p>The same year, on 6th July, the king prolonged the term during
which this exceptional tax should be levied to three years (p. 476&#x2a;);
he also, “understanding that it would hurt neither himself nor the
city,” granted to the mayor and commonalty of London three empty
spaces, one near the wall of the churchyard “de Wolchurch,” the
two others near the wall of St. Paul’s churchyard, for them to build
thereon and let the buildings for the benefit of the bridge (10 Ed. I
m. 11). Then, in the thirty-fourth year of his reign, Edward I
established a detailed tariff of the tolls which all merchandise passing
under or over the bridge should pay during the next three years
(34 Ed. I m. 25). Even this was not enough, as we find Edward II
asking all the archbishops, bishops, rectors and other ecclesiastical
authorities of the kingdom to well receive the wardens of London
Bridge or their delegates and allow them to piously persuade the
people to make offerings for the repair of the bridge: “Eos populum
ibidem piis suasionibus excitare et suarum elemosinarum subsidia
ad reparationem Pontis predicti caritative invocare permittatis.”
(14 Ed. II pt. i. m. 19, p. 477&#x2a;).

<span class="hatitle">INQUESTS RE­LAT­ING TO THE
MAIN­TE­NANCE OF BRIDGES</span></h3>

<p>A great many examples of these inquests may be found in the
collection published by the Record Commission, “Placitorum in
domo capitulari Westmonasteriensi asservatorum abbreviatio,” London,
1811, fol. Here are references to some of the more interesting
ones:</p>

<p>Case where an abbot is explicitly obliged, as one of the conditions
of his tenure, to repair a bridge, p. 205; 11 and 12 Ed. I.</p>

<p>Agreement between the abbot of Croyland and the prior of
Spalding for the construction of several bridges, p. 205; 12 Ed. I.</p>

<p>Discussion as to the building of a bridge at Chester, p. 209;
13 Ed. I.</p>

<p>Refusal by the abbot of Coggeshall to repair a bridge: “Per
juratores, Abbas de Coggeshale non tenetur reparare pontem de
Stratford inter Branketre et Coggeshale, eo quod de tempore memorie
non fuit ibidem alius pons quam quedam planchea de borde super
quam omnes transeuntes salvo et secure transire potuerunt,” p. 303;
1 Ed. II.</p>

<p>Measures taken to constrain the inhabitants of two towns to
repair the bridges of a highway in their neighbourhood: “Distringantur
villate de Aswardeby et Skredington ad reparandum
pontes in pupplica strata inter Lafford et ecclesiam de Stowe juxta
inquisicionem inde captam anno lvi. Henrici iij. coram Gilberto
de Preston et sociis suis in comitatu Lincolniensi itinerantibus, per
breve ejusdem regis,” p. 305; 2 Ed. II.</p>

<p>Finding out of the person who is to repair Chesford bridge,
p. 314; 6 Ed. II.</p>

<p>Refusal of the abbot of Fountains to repair Bradeley bridge,
p. 318; 7 Ed. II.</p>

<p>Hamo de Morston’s case, p. 328; 11 Ed. II, referred to above,
p. 64.</p>

<p>Repair of the bridges of Exhorne, Hedecrone, and Hekinby,
in the county of Kent, p. 339; 15 Ed. II.</p>

<p>Inquest as to Claypole bridge. It is found that the
inhabitants of Claypole are bound to repair it: “Ideo
preceptum est vicecomiti Lincolniensi quod distringat
homines predicte ville de Claypole ad reparandum et
sustentandum pontem predictum in forma predicta,” p. 350;

homme soleit passer Humbre entre Hesel et Barton, homme à chival
pour dener, homme à pée pur une maele, qe ore sunt il, par extorsion,
mis à duble; et de ceo priunt remedi pur Dieu.” The king, in
reply, orders that the masters of the ferry shall not take more than
formerly: “vel quod significent causam quare id facere noluerint.”

<p>On the question of sanctuaries the councils are explicit:
“Firmiter prohibemus ne quis fugientes ad ecclesiam, quos ecclesia
debet tueri, inde violenter abstrahat, aut ipsos circa ecclesiam
obsideat, vel eisdem substrahat victualia.” Concilium provinciale
Scoticanum,
<span class="smmaj">A.D.</span> 1225, in Wilkins’ “Concilia Magnæ Britanniæ,”
London, 1737, vol. i. p. 616.</p>

<p>As shown by the reports of cases in the Year Books, good care
was to be taken by the refugee to flee to a church duly “dedicated
by a bishop.” Here is a case of the time of Edward I:—</p>

<p>“Quid[a]m captus fuit pro latrocinio, et ductus coram justiciariis
et inculpatus, dixit: Domine, ego fui in ecclesia de N. et dehinc
vi abstractus, unde imprimis peto juris beneficium quod mittar
retro unde ibi fui vi abstractus.—<i>Justiciarius.</i> Nos dicimus quod
ecclesia illa nunquam fuit dedicata per episcopum.—Priso. Sic,
domine.—<i>Justiciarius.</i> Inquiratur per duodecim:—Qui dixerunt
quod illa ecclesia nunquam fuit dedicata per episcopum.—<i>Justiciarius.</i>
Modo oportet te respondere.—<i>Priso.</i> Sum bonus et fidelis: ideo
de bono et malo pono, etc. (formula of submission to the decision
of a jury, <i>patria</i>).—Duodecim nominati
exiverunt ad deliberandos <span class="xxpn" id="p435">{435}</span>
(<i>sic</i>).” “Year Books,” edited by A. Horwood, 1863, vol. i. p. 541,
Rolls Series. The final result is not given. The Year Books not
infrequently give accounts of cases where the right of sanctuary
is invoked by mere thieves as ready as any to avail themselves of the
privilege.</p>

<p>The abuses resulting from the right of sanctuary, especially
with reference to St. Martin’s le Grand in London, are described
as follows in one of the Commons’ petitions: “Item prient les

(ED­WARD IV) OWN MIN­STRELS</span></h3>

<p>“<i>Pro Fraternitate Ministrallorum Regis</i>” (Rymer, “Fœdera,”
24, 1469). “Rex (etc.) .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Sciatis quod
ex querelosa insinuatione <span class="xxpn" id="p436">{436}</span>
dilectorum nobis Walteri Haliday, marescalli, Johannis Cliff (and
six others) ministrallorum nostrorum accepimus qualiter nonnulli,
rudes agricolæ et artifices diversarum misterarum Regni nostri
Angliæ, finxerunt se fore ministrallos, quorum aliqui liberatam
nostram eis minime datam portarent, seipsos etiam fingentes esse
ministrallos nostros proprios, cujus quidem liberatæ ac dictæ artis sive
occupationis ministrallorum colore, in diversis partibus regni nostri
prædicti, grandes pecuniarum exactiones de ligeis nostris deceptive
colligunt et recipiunt, et licet ipsi in arte vel sive occupatione illa
minime intelligentes sive experti existant, et in diversis artibus et
operationibus diebus ferialibus sive profestis utuntur et victum suum
inde sufficienter percipiant, de loco tamen ad locum, in diebus festivalibus,
discurrunt, et proficua ilia totaliter percipiunt, e quibus
ministralli nostri prædicti, et cæteri ministralli nostri pro tempore
existentes, in arte sive occupatione prædicta sufficienter eruditi et
instructi, nullisque aliis laboribus, occupationibus sive misteris utentes,
vivere deberent.”</p>

<p>For which cause, permission has been granted:
“Ministrallis nostris quod ipsi, ad laudem et honorem Dei
et ut specialius exorare teneantur pro salubri statu nostro
et præcarissimæ consortis nostræ Elizabethæ reginæ Angliæ,
dum agimus in humanis et pro animabus nostris cum ab hac
luce migraverimus, necnon pro anima carissimi domini et
patris nostri .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. tam in capella Beatæ Mariæ
Virginis infra ecclesiam cathedralem sancti Pauli Londoniæ,
quam in libera capella nostra regia sancti Anthonii, in
eadem civitate nostra Londoniæ, quandam fraternitatem sive
gildam (quam ut accepimus fratres et sorores fraternitatis
ministrallorum regni nostri prædicti, retroactis temporibus
inierunt.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.) stabilire, continuare
et augmentare ac quascumque personas, tam homines quam
mulieres eis grato animo adhærentes, in fratres et sorores
fraternitatis sive gildæ prædictæ recipere .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
possint et valeant.”</p>

<p>And for the good of the reconstituted gild, “volumus
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. quod nullus ministrallus regni nostri
prædicti, quamvis in hujusmodi arte sive occupatione
sufficienter eruditus existat, eadem arte .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
de cætero, nisi de fraternitate sive gilda prædicta sit
et ad eandam admissus fuerit et cum cæteris confratribus
ejusdem contribuent aliquo modo utatur.”</p>

<p>The beneficiaries of his monopoly will have a right
to inquire throughout the realm, “de omnibus et singulis
hujusmodi personis fingentibus se fore ministrallos,”
and to impose fines to be used “pro continua et perpetua
sustentatione certarum candelarum cerearum vulganter
nuncupatarum <i>tapers</i>,” in the before-mentioned chapels.

<span class="hatitle">THE FIRST RECORDED CRUC­I­FIX IN ENG­LAND
SCULP­TURED FROM LIFE</span></h3>

<p>Thomas of Burton, Abbot of Meaux, near Beverley, writes:
“Dictus autem Hugo abbas xv<sup>us</sup> crucifixum
novum in choro conversorum fecit fabricari. Cujus quidem
operarius nullam ejus formosam et notabilem proprietatem
sculpebat nisi in feria sexta, in qua pane et aqua tantum
jejunavit. Et hominem nudum coram se stantem prospexit,
secundum cujus formosam imaginem crucifixum ipsum aptius
decoraret. Per quem etiam crucifixum Omnipotens manifesta
miracula fecerat incessanter. Unde tunc etiam putabatur
quod, si mulieres ad dictum crucifixum accessum haberent,
augmentaretur communis devotio, et in quam plurimum
commodum nostri monasterii, redundaret. Super quo abbas
Cistercii a nobis requisitus, suam licentiam nobis
impertivit ut homines et mulieres honestæ accedere possent
ad dictum crucifixum, dum tamen mulieres per claustrum et
dormitorium seu alia officina intrare non permittantur.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Cujus quidem licentiæ prætextu, malo
nostro, feminæ sæpius aggrediuntur dictum crucifixum,
præcipue cum in eis frigescat devotio, dum illuc ut
ecclesiam tantum introspiciant accesserint, et sumptus
nostros augeant in hospitatione earundem.”</p>

<span class="hatitle">THE PILGRIMAGE OF REYNARD</span></h3>

<p>Tired of his sins, duly shriven, ordered by the hermit to go to
Rome, and there receive absolution, Reynard,</p>

<p class="pcontinue">and whom he persuades to go with him, thus avoiding, he suggests,
being eaten by his owners. A third member, the donkey, is soon
added to their party:</p>

</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">and he is easily persuaded to follow. They enter the forest. Night
comes. Where shall they find shelter? Why should we, Reynard
remarks, look for any other “ostel” than the fine grass under this
tree?</p>

<p id="p447">Appealing as must have been the fine grass to him, Belin objects,
the wood being so dangerous. So they continue their journey until

When Henry VIII gave the lands of the dissolved monastery of
Christ Church to Canterbury Cathedral, he declared that he made this
donation “in order that charity to the poor, the reparation of roads and
bridges, and other pious offices of all kinds should multiply and spread
afar.” Elton, “Tenures of Kent,” London, 1867, p. 21. The gift is
made “in liberam, puram et perpetuam eleemosynam.” This pious
character was long continued: “As late as the period of the Commonwealth
land and money devoted to the maintenance of bridges and causeys were
definitely included among the charitable uses which were to be unaffected
by the sequestration of Bishops’ land and other ecclesiastical revenues.”

This practice was inherited from the Roman builders, whose formularies
continued to be transcribed throughout the middle ages. See Victor
Mortet: “Un Formulaire du VIII<sup>e</sup> siécle pour les fondations d’édifices
et de ponts d’après des sources d’origine antique,” in “Bulletin monumental
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. de la Société française d’Archéologie,” vol. 71, 1907, p. 443.
The brief chapter in the “Mappæ Clavicula” (still copied in the twelfth
century), entitled “De fabrica in aqua,” recommends that, “Si fabricam
in aqua necesse fuerit erigere, facis arcam triangulam,” <i>arca</i> meaning <i>caisson</i>.
In this we see, Mr. Mortet writes, “la disposition venue de l’antiquité, transmise
et maintenue au moyen-âge, de la forme prismatique triangulaire des
avant-becs des ponts” (p. <a href="#p461" title="go to &#x70;. 461">461</a>). This characteristic was conspicuous, <i>e.g.</i>
in the Avignon and London bridges (see the picture, p.
<a href="#fig08" title="go to Illustration 8">45</a>) as well as in the
famous Roman Pont du Gard.</p></div>

This was a quite usual practice. The popes, who had every reason to
be interested in the welfare of the great bridge at Avignon, published
numerous bulls granting indulgences and other spiritual favours to the
benefactors of the edifice. See “Bullaire des indulgences concédées avant
1431 à l’œuvre du Pont d’Avignon,” published by the Marquis de Ripert-Monclar,
Paris, 1912. The work contains the Latin text of papal bulls
of 1281, 1290, 1343, 1353, 1366, 1371, 1397, 1430, 1431. The bull
of 1343, issued by Pope Clement VI, at Avignon, grants to givers “tres
annos et tres quadragenas,” and, under certain conditions, a plenary indulgence
at the time of death: “Siquis vero catholicus dictis fratribus .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
secundum quantitatem substancie et qualitatem .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. de bonis sibi a Deo
collatis dederit vel transmiserit quoquo modo ad reparacionem dicti pontis,
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. si talis infra annum .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. vere penitens ac confessus ab hac luce decesserit,
volumus et gratia speciali concedimus quod ab omnibus peccatis suis
remaneat absolutus.” As for those who should be so bold as to hamper
in any way the collections made by the brothers for their bridge, their
punishment would be nothing less than excommunication (p. 6).</p></div>

century, compliments the city on its beauties, and especially its
bridge:</p>

in 1545–6, writes in his note-book: “A certain very large
bridge is built, affording a passage to those in the city
to the opposite inhabited bank, supported by stone cemented
arches, and having also houses and turrets upon it.”

La Tour-Landry relates a story of a holy hermit who saw in a dream
his nephew’s wife in purgatory. The demons were pushing burning needles
into her eyebrows. An angel told him that it was because she had trimmed
her eyebrows and temples, and increased her forehead, and plucked out
her hair, thinking to beautify herself and to please the world. “Le livre

The king’s sister. Devon’s “Issues of the
Exchequer,” 1837, p. 142. As Englished by Devon, the Latin
text referred to would mean that the receiver of the money
and maker of the carriage was Master la Zousche, but la
Zousche was the clerk of the wardrobe, who had the money
from the Exchequer to give it to John le Charer, “per manus
John le Charer.” <i>Per</i> has here the meaning of <i>pro</i>, a
use of the word of which several instances may be found in
Du Cange. This indication of Devon’s mistake is due to the
late Mr. Bradshaw, of Cambridge.</p></div>

In many places great people, lay or
ecclesiastic, had somehow secured for themselves the
properly royal privilege of holding the “view”; it became
attached to some manors and was conveyed with them. See the
petition of an abbess who claims the view of frankpledge
attached to the manor of Shorwalle, Isle of Wight, which
had been given her; Isabella de Forte disputes her this
right, the real object of the quarrel between the two
ladies being the fines levied when the view was held.</p>

thus defined in the “Grand Coutumier de Normandie,” chap. 54: “Il
ne doit être crié fors pour cause criminelle, si comme pour feu et pour larcin

in 1827.</p></div>

“Household Expenses of Richard de Swinfield,” ed. J. Webb, 1854,
Camden Society, vols. i. p. 125, ii. pp. xxx–xxxvi. The duels of Thomas
de Bruges were not those of the cases of felony and crime which resulted
in the death of the vanquished; it was merely the duel with staff and shield,
<i>cum fuste et scuto</i>, which required, as may be imagined, the replacement
of the champion much less frequently. In the twenty-ninth year of Edward
III, a duel took place by means of champions between the Bishop of Salisbury
and the Earl of Salisbury. When the judges, conformably to the
laws, came to examine the dress of the combatants, they found that the
bishop’s champion had several sheets of prayers and incantations sown in
his garments (“Year Books of Edward I,” Rolls Series, 32–33d year, preface,
p. xvi, note). This examination of the clothing was always made with the
intention of discovering frauds of this kind, which were considered as the
most dangerous and disloyal of all.</p></div>

Richard II had several times to renew and
confirm them, but without effect. In his first statute upon
this subject he condemns the superabundance of retainers
which many men, though of indifferent means, delight in;
he declares “that divers people of small revenue of land,
rent, or other possessions, do make great retinue of
people, as well of esquires as of other, in many parts of
the realm” (1 Richard II, cap. 7,
<span class="smmaj">A.D.</span> 1377). The
third statute of 13 Richard II, that of his 16th year (cap.
4), that of his 20th year (cap. 1 and 2), are likewise
directed against the abuse of liveries and the number of
retainers of the “lords spiritual and temporal.” Henry VI
renewed these statutes, also without result.</p></div>

The picture in this statute is so complete
that there is scarcely need to quote other texts; they are,
however, numerous. In the petitions to parliament will
be found many complaints by private people for acts of
violence of which they had been victims, for imprisonment
by their enemies, robberies, arson, destruction of game
or fish in the parks. Examples: petition of Agnes Atte
Wode, she and her son beaten and robbed (ibid. i. p. 372);
of Agnes of Aldenby, beaten by malefactors (“Rolls of
Parliament,” i. p. 375); of the inhabitants of several
towns of the county of Hertford, who have been imprisoned
and forced to pay ransom by the knight John of Patmer (i.
p. 389); of John of Grey, who was attacked by fifteen
malefactors so resolute as to set fire to a town and storm
a castle (i. p. 397); of Robert Power, who is robbed and
his mansion sacked, his people beaten, by “men all armed
as men of war” (i. p. 410); of Ralph le Botiller, who has
seen his mansion pillaged and burnt by eighty men, who came
with arms and baggage, bringing ropes and hatchets on carts
(ii. p. 88), etc. In France, it is well known, the misdeeds
of this kind were still more numerous but then a continual
state of war was raging there.</p></div>

Penance of this kind was not applied only to
men. Women of all ranks were obliged to submit to it. In
the same Register Palatine of Durham may be seen the case
of Isabella of Murley, condemned for adultery with her
sister’s husband, John d’Amundeville, to receive publicly
“six whippings around the market of Durham” (vol. ii. p.
695). The case was not one of people of the lower sort; the
Amundeville family was powerful and old-established in the
county. Particulars about them from the thirteenth century
may be found in Surtees, “History and Antiquities of the
County Palatine of Durham,” London, 1823, vol. iii. p.

“Statutes of the Realm,” i. p. 250, text of
uncertain date, but probably of the reign of Edward II. All
this was classified as “Abuses” by the not very trustworthy
author of the “Mirror for Justices” (Andrew Horne?), early
fourteenth century, ed. Whittaker and Maitland, Selden
Soc., 1895, p. 158. At all events it was the law. According
to “Fleta,” lib. i. cap. xxix, at the end of forty days in
sanctuary, if the malefactors have not abjured the kingdom,
food must be refused to them, and they will no longer be
allowed to emigrate. On the road to the port, according
to the same, the felon wore a garb which would cause him
to be recognized, being “ungirt, un-shod, bare-headed, in
his bare shirt, as if he were to be hanged on the gallows,
having received a cross in his hands,” “discinctus et
discalceatus, capite discooperto, in pura tunica, tanquam
in patibulo suspendendus, accepta cruce in manibus.”
“Fleta” stated that he must try to cross, till he got into
water, not up to the knees, but up to the neck. On the
“Abjuratio Regni,” see the capital article, with a complete
bibliography of the subject by André Réville, in the “Revue
Historique,” Sept. 1892.</p></div>

Statute 2 Rich. II, stat. 2, chap. 3. These
frauds had been already complained of under Edward III.
A petition of the Commons in the parliament of 1376–77
(“Rolls of Parliament,” ii. p. 369), declares that certain
people, after having received money or merchandise on loan,
and having made a pretended gift of all their property to
friends, “flee to Westminster, St. Martin’s, or other such
privileged places, and lie there a long time, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. so long
that the said creditors are only too pleased to take a
small part of their debt and release the rest.” Then the
debtors return home, and their friends give them back their
property.</p></div>

sanctuary, in 1532, has been printed by the Rev. J. C.
Cox, showing that “there were then fifty fugitives,
including one woman under the protection of the abbey,
as life prisoners, one of whom had been there for twenty
years. Sixteen were there for felonies, probably all
robberies, eleven for murder or homicide, eighteen for
debt, and two for sacrilege,” the church having particular
merit in protecting the latter. One was a priest: “Sir
James Whytakere, preste, for murdre”; some were there for
a matter so small as to inspire pity: “John ap Howell
for felony; a poore mane, for stellynge of herrings.”

has several times granted his charter of pardon to
notorious robbers and to common murderers, when it is given
him to understand that they are staying for his wars beyond
the sea, whence they suddenly return into their country

A characteristic example of thief-catching, the man being a vagabond,
is in Thorold Rogers: William atte Lane had “feloniously bereft Richard
[de Herbarton] of a striped gown, worth ten shillings.” Richard ran after
him, “cum hutesio et clamore,” and the man was caught “by the bailiff
of the liberty of Holywell, Oxford.” William pleaded not guilty and
asked for a jury, “ponit se super patriam.” The jury found him guilty,
ordered that he restitute the gown to Richard, and as he had no goods to
make atonement, and was “a vagabond belonging to no ward,” he be hanged,
“suspendatur,” (Dec. 8, 1337); the marginal note “susp.” shows that
he was actually hanged. “Hist. of Agriculture,” ii. 665.</p></div>

This power of running down the first comer was, like many practices
of the time, at once a guarantee for public safety and a dangerous
arm in the hands of felons. Robbers used it, and it happened sometimes
that they imprisoned by this means their own victims. Alisot, wife of
Henry of Upatherle, sets forth to the king that her husband was made
prisoner by the Scotch at the battle of Stirling, remained their captive more
than a year, then returned after having paid forty pounds ransom. In
his absence, Thomas of Upatherle and Robert of Prestbury seized on the
fields which he possessed at Upatherle, divided them, pulled down the
houses and acted as the owners, taking to their own homes all the goods they
could move. The prisoner’s return surprised them; as soon as they knew
that he had re-appeared on his lands, “the said Thomas, by false agreement
between him and the said Robert, raised hue and cry on the said Henry
and put upon him that he had robbed him (Thomas) of his chattels to
the value of £100.” They were believed; “the said Henry was taken
and imprisoned in Gloucester castle for a long time,” waiting for the coming
of the justices, exactly as the statute said. Henry recovered his liberty
in the end, and obtained a writ against his enemies; but they brought force
and came to meet their victim, “and beat the said Henry in the town of
Gloucester, that is they bruised his two arms, both his thighs, and both
his legs, and his head on both sides, and quite wrecked and vilely treated
his body, so that he barely escaped death.” The king’s reply is not satisfactory:
“If the husband be alive, the plaint is his, if he be dead the wife’s
plaint is nothing.” “Rolls of Parliament,” vol. ii. p. 35,

“Let scarlet cloth be taken, and let him who is suffering small-pox
be entirely wrapped in it or in some other red cloth; I did thus when the
son of the illustrious King of England suffered from small-pox; I took

<p>To which Gaddesden, I now make humble apologies: for since the
above lines were written years ago, modern discoveries, those especially of
Niels Finsen, of Copenhagen, a man of the truest worth, whom I saw
at work, have justified him. Red light, it has been found, really has an
influence on the healing of the scars left by small-pox, and even of the
disease itself. So, biding the time when his beetle remedy, mentioned
next, may prove operative too, I hold Gaddesden justified in turning, from
above, the laugh on his deriders: and I submit to the penance in the
same contrite spirit as Dr. Johnson once did at Uttoxeter.</p></div>

Brilliantly illuminated manuscripts of
romances continued, however, to multiply; they were very
well paid for. Edward III bought, in 1331, of Isabella of
Lancaster, nun of Aumbresbury, a book of romance for which
he paid her £66 13s. 4d., which was an enormous sum. When
the king had this book he kept it in his own room (Devon’s
“Issues of the Exchequer,” 1837, p. 144). Richard II (ibid.
213) bought a bible in French, a “Roman de la Rose,” and
a “Roman de Perceval” for £28. To give an idea of these
prices we must recall, for example, that a few years before
Edward bought his book of romance, the inhabitants of
London entered in the City accounts £7 10s. for ten oxen,
£4 for twenty pigs, and £6 for twenty-four swans, which
they had given to the king. Year 1328, Riley’s “Memorials

At Exeter Cathedral may be seen many of the musical instruments
used in the fourteenth century, sculptured in the “Minstrels’ Gallery,”
where angels are performing (see the plate). The instruments they use
have been identified by M. Carl Engel as being: the cittern, the bag-pipe,
the clarion, the rebec, the psaltery, the syrinx, the sackbut, the regals, the
gittern, the shalm, the timbrel, the cymbals. “Musical Instruments,”
South Kensington Museum Art Handbook, p. 113. [The duties of the
court minstrels of Edward IV are declared in the Black Book of the Orders
of that king’s household (Harl. MS. 610, fol. 23), and their instruments
are enumerated; “some vse trumpetts, some shalmes, some small pipes,
some are stringe-men.” L. T. S.]</p></div>

Ballads,” London, second edition, 1832. Most of them are only of the
sixteenth century, but a few are of an earlier date. Robin Hood’s popularity
was, however, well established in the fourteenth century, as shown

Performing animals or wild ones in cages
enjoyed a popularity which proved more constant than
that of minstrels, since it has continued unabated from
the early middle ages to the present time. <i>Ursinarii</i>
frequently appear in the accounts of the Shrewsbury
corporation quoted by Chambers who gives, e.g. this
noteworthy entry: “In regardo dato ursinario domini Regis
pro agitacione bestiarum suarum ultra denarios tunc ibidem
collectos.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” (Mediæval Stage, ii. 251; year 1517).
The English kings, as is well known, had their ménagerie
in the Tower, as the French ones had theirs in Paris. St.
Louis sent, “as a great gift,” in 1255, an elephant to
Henry III; “and we do not believe any had been seen before
in England,” wrote Matthew Paris who, good draughtsman as
he was, painted the portrait of the wondrous beast. The
miniature in MS. Nero D I, in the British Museum, fol. 169,
is by him, according to Madden, “Historia Anglorum,” Rolls,
Preface.</p></div>

Extract from a letter to the author:
“Yesterday I was reading your ‘Vie Nomade,’ and that
portion of it which speaks of the rewards given in
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries to messengers who
brought good tidings
to the king. It may interest you to know that
a remnant of this custom still survives. The officer sent
by a general after a victory to convey the despatch to
the Queen, receives besides a promotion in rank (or a
decoration), a pecuniary reward. The officer who brought
the news of the fall of Sebastopol to the Queen received
the rank of Colonel, and a present of 500 guineas.</p>

<p>“My brother A.D.C., Major Anson, who carried home
from China the despatch announcing the fall of Pekin,
was promoted Colonel, and received a present of 500
guineas.—St. James’ Club, May 30, 1890.—F. Grant.”</p>

<p>What happened, in our less ceremonious days, when the news
was brought of the Marne, of Ypres, of Messines? Doubtless
it was not brought; it came.</p></div>

The English coaling trade had greatly
increased in the fourteenth century; large quantities
of coal were brought by water from Newcastle and other
places to London and partly consumed on the spot, partly
exported. The importance of coal mines did not escape the
notice of the Commons, who stated in the year 1376–7 that,
“en diverses parties deinz le Roialme d’Engleterre sont
diverses miners de carbons, dont les communes du dit partie
ont lour sustenantz en grande partie.” 51 Ed. III, “Rolls

The trade in wines was enormous, especially
with Gascony, and subjected to the most minute regulations.
Not only the importation of it was the occasion of
ceaseless interfering, but the retail sale in towns was
perpetually regulated anew by local ordinances. Woe to the
vintner who was detected meddling in any unfair way with
his liquor; he might experience the chastisement inflicted
upon John Penrose, who for such an offence was sent to the
pillory in 1364, was made to drink publicly there his own
stuff, had what he could not drink poured over his head,
and was besides sentenced to renounce his trade for ever.

one to this day, and lasts eight days. The fair for horses

W. W. Skeat, “Vision concerning Piers the Plowman,” ii,
83. See a list of English fairs in Mr. Elton’s Report,
Market Rights Commission, 1889, vol. i. 5. There were fairs
established especially for herrings and other fishing
produce at Yarmouth, Scarborough, and other towns on the
sea-coast. The rigours of Lent and the number of fasting
days throughout the year gave particular importance to
these articles of consumption. Hence, too, the attention
paid to fisheries and the regulations to prevent the
catching of small fish, the destruction of spawn and bait,
etc. Great complaints are made against the use of the net
called “wondyrchoun,” which drags from the bottom of the
sea all the bait “that used to be the food of great fish.”
Through means of this instrument fishermen catch “such
great plenty of small fish that they do not know what to do
with them, but fatten their pigs
with them.” “Rolls of Parliament,” 1376–7, vol. ii. p. 369. As to
salmon fishing in the Thames, see ibid., vol. ii. p. 331, A.D. 1376.</p></div>

In the case of this woman, freedom was granted “propter parvitatem delicti,”
and because she had been one year in prison; and no confiscation took place,
because her husband was absent in Paris, and it would have been inappropriate
to, maybe, wrong that man who was, like every husband, the owner
of his wife’s chattels. “Et nota,” beautifully adds the judge (or the reporter),
“quod melius est nocentem relinquere impunitum quam innocentem
punire.” But the court, at the same time, fines an innocent, known to it
as such, for fear of displeasing the king; a circumstance that the recorder
is bold enough to note down: “Et nota quod fecerunt hoc Justiciarii magis

Sometimes a man would profit by the absence of an enemy on
the continent and affirm to a magistrate that he was in
flight, and cause him to be declared an outlaw; thus the
priest, John Crochille, complains to parliament of having
been unjustly outlawed during a journey which he had made
to the Court of Rome, in 1347 (“Rolls of Parliament,” vol.
ii. p. 178); the priest, Robert of Thresk, is also declared
outlaw during his absence from the kingdom, “by the malice
of his accusers” (ibid., 1347, vol. ii. p. 183). John of
Gaunt orders the restitution of his goods to “nostre tenant

The year books of Edward I show a marked
tendency in the judge to interpret the laws and customs in
a sense favourable to the freeing of the villein. One of
the harsh theories of former days is declared by him “pejus

This was a last resort, more and more frequently adopted however,

disposition the villeins “were reluctant to abscond and throw up their
share of the manorial acres, for only in extremity will the peasant, who has
once got a grip on the soil, consent to let it go.” “The Great Revolt of

According to Seebohm (“The Black Death and its place in English
History,” two articles in the <i>Fortnightly Review</i> in 1865), more than half
of the population died during the epidemic which had begun in July 1348
and lasted till the end of 1349. Three archbishops of Canterbury died in
one year. Knyghton, a contemporary, gives a striking picture of the plague
at Leicester. “There were scarcely any who took heed of riches or cared
for anything. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And sheep and oxen wandered through the fields and
among the crops; there was no one to go after and collect them; but there
perished an untold number in out of the way ditches and under hedges.”
In the autumn the price of labour was so exorbitant that a large part of the
crops were left on the ground (Twysden’s “Decem Scriptores,” col. 2599).

and other towns and hamlets throughout the land have decayed, and from

Compare the French ordinances; that of John the Good,
January 30, 1350 (Isambert, “Recueil général des anciennes
lois françaises,” iv. p. 576), orders the idle people of
Paris, picturesquely described as “gens oiseux ou joueurs
de dez ou enchanteurs (singers) es rues ou truandans ou
mandians, de quelque estat ou condition qu’ils soient,
ayans mestier ou non, soient hommes ou femmes,” to either
work or go away, which was less radical and still less to
the point than the English rules. Another order of the same
king (Nov. 1354, ibid. p. 700)
was directed against the workmen who since the
plague were exacting exorbitant wages, and, in addition to
that, “wine, meat and other unwonted things.” If denied,
they preferred to do nothing but would go to taverns and
there had been heard to say that, “owing to the great
price they are accustomed to take, they will work only two
days a week,” a kind of difficulty which, dating back six
centuries, is not entirely of the past.</p></div>

<p>Some traces of kindness to his tenants, on the part of John
of Gaunt are found in his Registers. He orders wood and
charcoal to be carried to the castle of Tutbury where his
wife was to spend the winter, and insists that the work
be done in summer, so that his tenants and bondmen be not
grieved by the carrying thereof in the bad season.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. “Si
voullons et vous mandons que vous faces faire et carier
à nostre dit chastel ccc quarters de carbons, et aussint
vous faces carier tout la boys abatuz par vent que vous
bonement pourrez en nostre dit chastel pur fuaille, et que

And they said it in the most peremptory language, highly approving
of the king’s breaking his word and revoking the sweeping manumissions
(“manumisimus universos ligeos et singulos subditos nostros,” Walsingham,
ii. 467, Rolls) he had granted out of fear; the lords and the commons answer:
“à une voice qe cele repele fuist ben faite, adjoustant que tiele manumission
ou franchise des neifs ne poast estre fait sanz lour assent q’ont le greindre
interesse: a quoy ils n’assentèrent unques de lour bone grée, n’autrement,
ne jamais ne ferroient pur vivre et murrir touz en un jour.” “Rolls of
Parliament,” iii. p. 100; year 1381. So they would rather die, all of them
in a day, than assent to a freedom granted “without the assent of those
most interested”: and it never occurred to them that those most interested
could possibly be the villeins themselves and not the villeins’ masters.</p></div>

shown by “The tenor of the complaint made to the Kinge and
his councell against John Fox, Maior of Northampton, and
others exhibited in French by Richard Stermersworthe, a
wolman,” year 1392–3. According to the deponent the Mayor
who welcomes every “errant Lollard,” has caused “the whole towne in
manner to become Lollardes. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. All ribauds infected with Lollardry, that
come to the said towne are all courteously received and maintayned as yf
they were prophetts before all others.” The day after Christmas, the
Mayor “brought with him .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. an errant Lollard to preach within
All Saints Church.” He did the same later, bringing the “parson of the
church of Wynkpole, an errant Lollarde, to preach.” Powell and

Berners’ translation). The body of Charles de Blois, killed
at the battle of Auray in 1364, but this one an undoubtedly
pious warrior, also worked miracles, and Froissart imagined
that Urban V had canonized him: “His body [was] after

Pontefract on the one hand, and the Lord of Wake on the

III, p. 72, where, speaking of the immense popularity
of the pilgrimage to Saint James of Compostela in the
eleventh century, Bédier says: “Ce fut l’époque héroïque
du pèlerinage. C’est alors que la route romaine commence
à se peupler d’asiles pour les voyageurs; c’est alors
qu’exercent leur activité les saints que l’Eglise vénère
parce qu’ils furent de bons ingénieurs, réparant les
chaussées, desséchant les marécages, jetant des ponts

characteristic signs of pilgrims. In the romance of
King Horn, the hero meets on his road a <i>palmer</i>, and
to disguise himself changes clothes with him; in this

the large number of English ships at “Grwne” (Coruña), the
usual port of landing for Compostela: “In porto Grwne erant
de Anglicis, Wallicis, Hibernicis, Normannis, Francis,
Britonnibus et aliis LXXX<sup>ta</sup> naves cum topcastellis et
quatuor sine topcastellis; numerus navium Anglicarum erat
XXX<sup>ij</sup>.” He notes the words and music of a song sung by
little Spanish boys, dancing before pilgrims and offering
good wishes, in exchange for which they hoped to get some
small coin. “Itineraries,” Roxburghe Club, 1857, pp. 154,

Especially noteworthy in this respect at the present day is the Church
of Santa Maria delle Grazie, near Mantua (in which the famous author
of the “Cortegiano,” Baldassare Castiglione, is buried), where life-size,
realistic wax figures, wearing real garments or armour, form a continuous series
above the arches on both sides of the nave. Each scene commemorates
a miraculous intervention of the Virgin: innocents saved at the moment of
their execution, the halter breaking, the axe stopped, etc. The “custode”
also directs attention to a stuffed animal, dangling from the roof, and which
he describes as a “crocodilo” which used to desolate the country.</p></div>

William Wey, in the fifteenth century,
thus mentions the catacombs: “Item ibi est una spelunca
nuncupata Sancti Kalixti cimiterium, et qui eam pertransit
cum devocione, illi indulgentur omnia sua peccata. Et ibi
multa corpora sanctorum sunt, que nullus hominum numerare
nequit nisi solus Deus,” “The Itineraries of William Wey,”
Roxburghe Club, 1857, p. 146. Wey, like the author of the
poem, sometimes mentions prodigious numbers of bodies
of martyrs; at the church called Scala Celi, “sunt ossa
sanctorum decem millia militum;” in one single part of St.
Peter’s at Rome, are “Petronella et xiii millia sanctorum
martyrum.”</p></div>

duo ciphi, unus plenus sanguine Ihesu Cristi, and alter plenus lacte beate
Marie Virginis,” “Itineraries,” p. 146. Those who drink at the three
fountains which gushed out at the death of St. Paul are cured of all maladies;
those who visit the church of St. Mary of the Annunciation will never be
struck by lightning; at the church of St. Vivian there is “herba crescens quam
ipsa plantavit et valet contra caducum morbum.” At the church of St.
Sebastian is shown a foot-print of Jesus; and it is, in fact, still to be
seen there at the present day. Ibid. pp. 143–148.</p></div>

notes by W. M. Rossetti on the “Stacions,” pp. xxi–xlviii, paralleling the
information furnished by the English author with that given by the Italian
Francino, who wrote on the same subject in 1600, and whose numbers are
much less exaggerated. Mr. Rossetti states also what is still shown at Rome

<p>The Saint Luke legend appears in a somewhat different form in William
Wey, according to whom the saint was about to paint when he fell asleep,
and the angels made the picture for him, “Itineraries,” p. 143. A similar

called in the middle ages the “Saint Vou” (the Holy Face, <i>vultus</i>),
at Lucca, begun by Nicodemus after the Ascension, and miraculously
finished during his sleep. Bédier, “Légendes épiques,” 1908, II. 210.</p></div>

He and numerous companions had received
the Cross at the hands of the Patriarch of Jerusalem in
1316, and the plan seemed for a time so near realization
that nobles and villeins sold their lands and houses,
to take part in the crusade. A plan thereof and a draft
of the contract with the Marseilles shipowners has been
published with excellent notes, by A. de Boislisle,

Langland speaks of the Saracens without cursing them; they might

The voyages called “Mandeville’s Voiage and
Travaile” were assuredly written in the fourteenth century
in French, then were translated e.g. into Latin and
English. Only the portion relating to Egypt, Palestine,
and Syria, <i>may</i> have been founded on a real journey.
The article “Mandeville,” by Mr. E. B. Nicholson and
Colonel Yule in “The Encyclopædia Britannica”; a paper,
“Untersuchungen über Johann von Mandeville und die
Quelle seiner Reiseschreibung,” Berlin, 1888 (printed in
“Zeitschrift der Gesellschaft für Erdkunde,” bd. xxiii. p.
177), and Mr. G. F. Warner’s “The Buke of John Maundevil,”
being the travels of Sir John Mandeville, Kt. 1322–56,
Roxb. Club, 1889, fol., with the French and English texts;
the notice by the same on Mandeville in the “Dictionary
of National Biography,” notices by H. Cordier in his
“Bibliotheca Sinica” and in “Revue Critique,” Oct. 26,
1891, represent the actual state of the question. English
text in modern spelling, ed. Pollard, London, 1900.
Earliest dated MS., a French one in the National Library,
Paris,
<span class="smmaj">A.D.</span> 1371;
the identification of Mandeville with Jean
de Bourgogne, <i>alias</i> “à la Barbe,” or “ad Barbam,” a
physician of Liège, who died there in 1372, seems certain.</p></div>

And a very large quantity, beginning as early
as the fourth century (to
which century belongs the “Itinerarium Burdigala Hierosolymam”), had
preceded those. See, among others, “Itinera Hierosolymitana et Descriptiones
Terræ Sancta,” ed. Tobler and Molinier, 1879, ff.; “Itinéraires à
Jérusalem, rédigés en français aux XI<sup>e</sup>, XII<sup>e</sup> et XIII<sup>e</sup> Siècles,” ed. Michelant
and Raynaud, 1882, both works forming part of the publications of the
“Société de l’Orient Latin.” One of the best among the older guide-books
was due to the French monk Bernard in the year 870. The monk, who
went by way of Egypt, is brief, accurate, matter of fact, as little emotional
as possible, discards all wonders, and is often careful to add: “asseritur,”
“dicitur.”</p></div>

band of 197 pilgrims embarked on two galleys. Born about
1407, a graduate of Oxford, Wey became after the last of
his journeys an Augustinian monk at Edington, Wiltshire,
and died there in 1476. He wrote his Itineraries “rogatus a
devotis viris” (p. 56); the text in Latin, the “prevysyoun”

of the Bodleian Library at Oxford. It is probable, but not quite sure, that
this is really the map of William Wey, the one he calls “mappa mea” in
his book. It has been reproduced in <i>fac-simile</i>: “Map of the Holy

Ibid. The same scramble for asses is going on even now in Palestine
and Egypt, and modern “Saracens” are careful to ingratiate themselves
with the traveller by addressing to him a few words in the language of his
supposed nationality; one such at the foot of the Pyramids some years ago,
would keep repeating to us, as a sesame for our purses, these three magic
words: “Bonaparte, quarante siècles.” We had not, however, to deplore

William Wey and his companions pay to the
“Saracen lords” fifteen ducats: “Et sic in Terra Sancta
fuimus xiij diebus, pro quibus solvimus pro conductu nostro
dominis Saracenis xv ducatus.” But there were two rival
sultans at war with each other, each claiming the Holy
Land; and just as the pilgrims were about to leave, the one
of those potentates whom they had not paid got the upper
hand, and they had to give fifty ducats to his new
governor of Jerusalem. “Itineraries,” p. 99. The second Boucicaut going
around the holy places for the second time within a few months in 1389,
is made by the Saracens to pay again. Delaville le Roulx, “La France en

TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE

<p class="pfirst">Original spelling and grammar have been generally
retained, with some exceptions noted below. Original
printed page numbers are shown like this: {52}.
Footnotes have been relabeled 1–598, converted to
endnotes, and moved to just ahead of
the Index. Illustrations have been moved from within
paragraphs to nearby locations between paragraphs.
Page numbers for dislocated full-page illustrations
are removed. I produced the cover image
and assign it to the public domain. Original
page images are available from archive.org—search for
“englishwayfaring00jussmiss”.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
